vexé
ce
matin
clarisse
qui

de

encore
juré
quon
commencerait
à
neuf
heures
précises
un
instant
ils
se
turent
levant
la

fouillant

le
papier

étaient
tapissées

assombrissait
encore
en

personnes
et

ça
doit
être
du
propre
il
se
calma
mais
le
vide
de
la
salle
le
demijour
du
lustre
ce
recueillement
déglise
plein
de
voix
chuchotantes
et
de
battements
de
porte
lagaçaient
ah
non
ditil
tout
à
coup
se
fait
trop
vieux
ici
moi
je
sors
nous
allons
peutêtre
trouver
bordenave
en
bas
il
nous
donnera
des
détails
en
bas
dans
le
grand
vestibule
dallé
de
marbre
où
était
installé
le
contrôle
le
public
commençait
à
se
montrer
par
les
trois
grilles
ouvertes
voyait
passer
la
vie
ardente
des
boulevards
qui
grouillaient
et
flambaient
sous
la
belle
nuit
davril
des
roulements
de
voiture
sarrêtaient
court
des
portières
se
refermaient
bruyamment
et
du
monde
entrait
par
petits
groupes
stationnant
devant
le
contrôle
montant
au
fond
le
double
escalier
où
les
femmes
sattardaient
avec
un
balancement
de
la
taille
dans
la
clarté
crue
du
gaz
sur
la
nudité
blafarde
de
cette
salle
dont
une
maigre
décoration
empire
faisait
un
péristyle
de
temple
en
carton
de
hautes
affiches
jaunes
sétalaient
violemment
avec
le
nom
de
nana
en
grosses
lettres
noires
des
messieurs
comme
accrochés
au
passage
les
lisaient
dautres
debout
causaient
barrant
les
portes
tandis
que
près
du
bureau
de
location
un
homme
épais
à
large
face
rasée
répondait
brutalement
aux
personnes
qui
insistaient
pour
avoir
des
places
voilà
bordenave
dit
fauchery
en
descendant
lescalier
mais
le
directeur
lavait
aperçu
eh
vous
êtes
gentil
lui
criatil
de
loin
cest
comme
ça
que
vous
mavez
fait
une
chronique
jai
ouvert
ce
matin
le
figaro
rien
attendez
donc
répondit
fauchery
il
faut
bien
que
je
connaisse
votre
nana
avant
de
parler
delle
je
nai
rien
promis
dailleurs
puis
pour
couper
court
il
présenta
son
cousin
hector
de
la
faloise
un
jeune
homme
qui
venait
achever
son
éducation
à
paris
le
directeur
pesa
le
jeune
homme
dun
coup
doeil
mais
hector
lexaminait
avec
émotion
cétait
donc
là
ce
bordenave
ce
montreur
de
femmes
qui
les
traitait
en
gardechiourme
ce
cerveau
toujours
fumant
de
quelque
réclame
criant
crachant
se
tapant
sur
les
cuisses
cynique
et
ayant
un
esprit
de
gendarme
hector
crut
quil
devait
chercher
une
phrase
aimable
votre
théâtre
commençatil
dune
voix
flûtée
bordenave
linterrompit
tranquillement
dun
mot
cru
en
homme
qui
aime
les
situations
franches
dites
mon
bordel
alors
fauchery
eut
un
rire
approbatif
tandis
que
la
faloise
restait
avec
son
compliment
étranglé
dans
la
gorge
très
choqué
essayant
de
paraître
goûter
le
mot
le
directeur
sétait
précipité
pour
donner
une
poignée
de
main
à
un
critique
dramatique
dont
le
feuilleton
avait
une
grande
influence
quand
il
revint
la
faloise
se
remettait
il
craignait
dêtre
traité
de
provincial
sil
se
montrait
trop
interloqué
dit
recommençatil
voulant
absolument
trouver
quelque
chose
que
nana
avait
une
voix
délicieuse
elle
sécria
le
directeur
en
haussant
les
épaules
une
vraie
seringue
le
jeune
homme
se
hâta
dajouter
du
reste
excellente
comédienne
elle
un
paquet
elle
ne
sait
où
mettre
les
pieds
et
les
mains
la
faloise
rougit
légèrement
il
ne
comprenait
plus
il
balbutia
pour
rien
au
monde
je
naurais
manqué
la
première
de
ce
soir
je
savais
que
votre
théâtre
dites
mon
bordel
interrompit
de
nouveau
bordenave
avec
le
froid
entêtement
dun
homme
convaincu
cependant
fauchery
très
calme
regardait
les
femmes
qui
entraient
il
vint
au
secours
de
son
cousin
lorsquil
le
vit
béant
ne
sachant
sil
devait
rire
ou
se
fâcher
fais
donc
plaisir
à
bordenave
appelle
son
théâtre
comme
il
te
le
demande
puisque
ça
lamuse
et
vous
mon
cher
ne
nous
faites
pas
poser
si
votre
nana
ne
chante
ni
ne
joue
vous
aurez
un
four
voilà
tout
cest
ce
que
je
crains
dailleurs
un
four
un
four
cria
le
directeur
dont
la
face
sempourprait
estce
quune
femme
besoin
de
savoir
jouer
et
chanter
ah
mon
petit
tu
es
trop
bête
nana
autre
chose
parbleu
et
quelque
chose
qui
remplace
tout
je
lai
flairée
cest
joliment
fort
chez
elle
ou
je
nai
plus
que
le
nez
dun
imbécile
tu
verras
tu
verras
elle
n
qu
à
paraître
toute
la
salle
tirera
la
langue
il
avait
levé
ses
grosses
mains
qui
tremblaient
denthousiasme
et
soulagé
il
baissait
la
voix
il
grognait
pour
lui
seul
oui
elle
ira
loin
ah
sacredié
oui
elle
ira
loin
une
peau
oh
une
peau
puis
comme
fauchery
linterrogeait
il
consentit
à
donner
des
détails
avec
une
crudité
dexpressions
qui
gênait
hector
de
la
faloise
il
avait
connu
nana
et
il
voulait
la
lancer
justement
il
cherchait
alors
une
vénus
lui
ne
sembarrassait
pas
longtemps
dune
femme
il
aimait
mieux
en
faire
tout
de
suite
profiter
le
public
mais
il
avait
un
mal
de
chien
dans
sa
baraque
que
la
venue
de
cette
grande
fille
révolutionnait
rose
mignon
son
étoile
une
fine
comédienne
et
une
adorable
chanteuse
cellelà
menaçait
chaque
jour
de
le
laisser
en
plan
furieuse
devinant
une
rivale
et
pour
laffiche
quel
bousin
grand
dieu
enfin
il
sétait
décidé
à
mettre
les
noms
des
deux
actrices
en
lettres
dégale
grosseur
il
ne
fallait
pas
quon
lennuyât
lorsquune
de
ses
petites
femmes
comme
il
les
nommait
simonne
ou
clarisse
ne
marchait
pas
droit
il
lui
allongeait
un
coup
de
pied
dans
le
derrière
autrement
pas
moyen
de
vivre
il
en
vendait
il
savait
ce
quelles
valaient
les
garces
tiens
ditil
en
sinterrompant
mignon
et
steiner
toujours
ensemble
vous
savez
que
steiner
commence
à
avoir
de
rose
pardessus
la
tête
aussi
le
mari
ne
le
lâchetil
plus
dune
semelle
de
peur
quil
ne
file
sur
le
trottoir
la
rampe
de
gaz
qui
flambait
à
la
corniche
du
théâtre
jetait
une
nappe
de
vive
clarté
deux
petits
arbres
se
détachaient
nettement
dun
vert
cru
une
colonne
blanchissait
si
vivement
éclairée
quon
lisait
de
loin
les
affiches
comme
en
plein
jour
et
audelà
la
nuit
épaissie
du
boulevard
se
piquait
de
feux
dans
le
vague
dune
foule
toujours
en
marche
beaucoup
dhommes
nentraient
pas
tout
de
suite
restaient
dehors
à
causer
en
achevant
un
cigare
sous
le
coup
de
lumière
de
la
rampe
qui
leur
donnait
une
pâleur
blême
et
découpait
sur
lasphalte
leurs
courtes
ombres
noires
mignon
un
gaillard
très
grand
très
large
avec
une
tête
carrée
dhercule
de
foire
souvrait
un
passage
au
milieu
des
groupes
traînant
à
son
bras
le
banquier
steiner
tout
petit
le
ventre
déjà
fort
la
face
ronde
et
encadrée
dun
collier
de
barbe
grisonnante
eh
bien
dit
bordenave
au
banquier
vous
lavez
rencontrée
hier
dans
mon
cabinet
ah
cétait
elle
sécria
steiner
je
men
doutais
seulement
je
sortais
comme
elle
entrait
je
lai
à
peine
entrevue
mignon
écoutait
les
paupières
baissées
faisant
tourner
nerveusement
à
son
doigt
un
gros
diamant
il
avait
compris
quil
sagissait
de
nana
puis
comme
bordenave
donnait
de
sa
débutante
un
portrait
qui
mettait
une
flamme
dans
les
yeux
du
banquier
il
finit
par
intervenir
laissez
donc
mon
cher
une
roulure
le
public
va
joliment
la
reconduire
steiner
mon
petit
vous
savez
que
femme
vous
attend
dans
sa
loge
il
voulut
le
reprendre
mais
steiner
refusait
de
quitter
bordenave
devant
eux
une
queue
sécrasait
au
contrôle
un
tapage
de
voix
montait
dans
lequel
le
nom
de
nana
sonnait
avec
la
vivacité
chantante
de
ses
deux
syllabes
les
hommes
qui
se
plantaient
devant
les
affiches
lépelaient
à
voix
haute
dautres
le
jetaient
en
passant
sur
un
ton
dinterrogation
tandis
que
les
femmes
inquiètes
et
souriantes
le
répétaient
doucement
dun
air
de
surprise
personne
ne
connaissait
nana
doù
nana
tombaitelle
et
des
histoires
couraient
des
plaisanteries
chuchotées
doreille
à
oreille
cétait
une
caresse
que
ce
nom
un
petit
nom
dont
la
familiarité
allait
à
toutes
les
bouches
rien
qu
à
le
prononcer
ainsi
la
foule
ségayait
et
devenait
bon
enfant
une
fièvre
de
curiosité
poussait
le
monde
cette
curiosité
de
paris
qui
la
violence
dun
accès
de
folie
chaude
voulait
voir
nana
une
dame
eut
le
volant
de
sa
robe
arraché
un
monsieur
perdit
son
chapeau
ah

cria
bordenave
quune
vingtaine
dhommes
assiégeaient
de
questions
vous
allez
la
voir
je
file
besoin
de
moi
il
disparut
enchanté
davoir
allumé
son
public
mignon
haussait
les
épaules
en
rappelant
à
steiner
que
rose
lattendait
pour
lui
montrer
son
costume
du
premier
acte
tiens
lucy
làbas
qui

calmée
brusquement

à
un

ne

devant

un
doigt
aux

faisait
signe
de

taire
et
sur
une
question
de
lucy
il
montra
un
jeune
homme
qui
passait
en
murmurant
le
greluchon
de
nana
tous
le
regardèrent
il
était
gentil
fauchery
le
reconnut

daguenet
un
garçon
qui
avait
mangé
trois
cent
mille
francs
avec
les
femmes
et
qui
maintenant
bibelotait
à

bourse
pour

une
poignée
de

avec
le

tandis
quune
vive
explication
avait
lieu
entre

bouchaient
le

si
aigu
que

écoutait

emmena

mais
à
présent
comme
un
écho
nana
sonnait
aux
quatre
coins
du
vestibule
sur
un
ton
plus
haut
dans
un
désir
accru
par
lattente

les

tiraient
leurs
montres
des
retardataires
sautaient
de
leurs
voitures
avant
quelles
fussent
arrêtées
des
groupes
quittaient
le
trottoir
où
les
promeneurs
lentement
traversaient
la
nappe
de
gaz
restée
vide
en
allongeant
le
cou
pour
voir
dans
le
théâtre
un
gamin
qui
arrivait
en
sifflant
se
planta
devant
une
affiche
à
la
porte
puis
il
cria
ohé
nana
dune
voix
de
rogomme
et
poursuivit
son
chemin
déhanché
traînant
ses
savates
un
rire

couru
des
messieurs
très
bien
répétèrent
nana
ohé
nana

une
querelle

au

une
clameur
grandissait
faite
du
bourdonnement
des

appelant
nana
exigeant

dans
un
de
ces
coups
desprit
bête
et
de
brutale
sensualité
qui
passent
sur
les
foules
mais
audessus
du
vacarme
la
sonnette
de

se
fit
entendre
une
rumeur
gagna
jusquau
boulevard
sonné

et
ce
fut
une
bousculade
chacun
voulait
passer
tandis
que
les

multipliaient

inquiet
reprit
enfin
steiner
qui
nétait

allé
voir
le

au
premier
tintement
la
faloise
avait
fendu
la
foule
en
entraînant
fauchery
pour
ne
pas
manquer
louverture
cet
empressement
du
public
irrita
lucy
stewart
en
voilà
de
grossiers
personnages
qui
poussaient
les
femmes
elle
resta
la
dernière
avec
caroline
héquet
et
sa
mère
le
vestibule
était
vide
au
fond
le
boulevard
gardait
son
ronflement
prolongé
comme
si
cétait
toujours
drôle
leurs

répétait
lucy
en
montant
lescalier
dans
la
salle
fauchery
et
la

devant

de

la

resplendissait
de
hautes
flammes
de
gaz
allumaient
le
grand
lustre
de
cristal
dun
ruissellement
de
feux
jaunes
et
roses
qui
se
brisaient
du
cintre
au
parterre
en
une
pluie
de
clarté
les
velours
grenat
des

se
moiraient
de

tandis
que
les
ors
luisaient
et
que
les
ornements
vert

en
adoucissaient
léclat
sous
les
peintures
trop
crues
du

haussée
la
rampe
dans
une
nappe
brusque
de
lumière
incendiait
le
rideau
dont
la
lourde
draperie
de
pourpre
avait
une
richesse
de
palais
fabuleux
jurant
avec
la
pauvreté
du
cadre
où
des
lézardes
montraient
le
plâtre
sous
la
dorure
il
faisait
déjà
chaud
leurs
pupitres
les
musiciens
accordaient
leurs
instruments
avec
des
trilles
légers
de
flûte
des
soupirs
étouffés
de
cor
des
voix
chantantes
de
violon
qui
senvolaient
au
milieu
du
brouhaha
grandissant
des
voix
tous
les
spectateurs
parlaient
se
poussaient
se
casaient
dans
lassaut
donné
aux
places
et
la
bousculade
des
couloirs
était
si
rude
que
chaque
porte
lâchait
péniblement
un
flot
de
monde
intarissable
cétaient
des
signes
dappel
des
froissements
détoffe
un
défilé
de
jupes
et
de
coiffures
coupées
par
le
noir
dun

ou
dune
redingote
pourtant
les
rangées
de
fauteuils
semplissaient
peu
à
peu
une
toilette
claire
se
détachait
une
tête
au
fin
profil
baissait
son
chignon
où
courait
léclair
dun
bijou
dans
une
loge
un
coin
dépaule
nue
avait
une
blancheur
de
soie
dautres
femmes
tranquilles
séventaient
avec
langueur
en
suivant
du
regard
les
poussées
de
la
foule
pendant
que
de
jeunes
messieurs
debout
à
lorchestre
le
gilet
largement
ouvert
un
gardénia
à
la
boutonnière
braquaient
leurs
jumelles
du
bout
de
leurs
doigts
gantés
alors
les
deux
cousins
cherchèrent
les
figures
de
connaissance
mignon
et
steiner
étaient
ensemble
dans
une
baignoire
les
poignets
appuyés
sur
le
velours
de
la
rampe
côte
à
côte
blanche
de
sivry
semblait
occuper
à
elle
seule
une
avantscène
du
rezdechaussée
mais
la
faloise
examina
surtout
daguenet
qui
avait
un
fauteuil
dorchestre
deux
rangs
en
avant
du
sien
près
de
lui
un
tout
jeune
homme
de
dixsept
ans
au

quelque
échappé
de

ouvrait
très
grands
ses
beaux

de
chérubin
fauchery
eut
un
sourire
en
le
regardant
quelle
est
donc
cette
dame
au
balcon
demanda
tout
à
coup
la
faloise
celle
qui
une
jeune
fille
en
bleu
près
delle

indiquait
une
grosse
femme
sanglée
dans
son
corset
une
ancienne
blonde
devenue
blanche
et
teinte
en
jaune
dont
la
figure
ronde
rougie
par
le
fard
se
boursouflait
sous
une
pluie
de
petits
frissons
enfantins
cest
gaga
répondit
simplement
fauchery
et
comme
ce
nom
semblait
ahurir
son
cousin
il
ajouta
tu
ne
connais
pas
gaga
elle
fait
les
délices
des
premières
années
du
règne
de
louisphilippe
maintenant
elle
traîne
partout
sa

avec
elle
la
faloise
neut

un

pour
la
jeune
fille
la
vue
de
gaga
lémotionnait
ses
yeux
ne
la
quittaient
plus
il
la
trouvait
encore
très
bien
mais
il
nosa
pas
le
dire
cependant
le
chef
dorchestre
levait
son
archet
les
musiciens
attaquaient
louverture
entrait
toujours
lagitation
et
le
tapage
croissaient
parmi
ce
public
spécial
des
premières
représentations
qui
ne
changeait
pas
il
avait
des
coins
dintimité
où
lon
se
retrouvait
en
souriant
des

singulièrement
mêlé

par

où
la

fatigue
et
la

fièvre
passaient
sur
les
visages

que
son
cousin
questionnait
lui
montra
les
loges
des
journaux
et
des
cercles
puis
il
nomma
les
critiques
dramatiques
un
maigre
lair
desséché
avec
de
minces
lèvres
méchantes
et
surtout
un
gros
de
mine
bon
enfant
se
laissant
aller
sur
lépaule
de
sa
voisine
une
ingénue
quil
couvait
dun
oeil
paternel
et
tendre
mais
il
sinterrompit
en
voyant
la
faloise
saluer
des
personnes
qui
occupaient
une
loge
de
face
il
parut
surpris
comment
demandatil
tu
connais
le
comte
muffat
de
beuville
oh
depuis
longtemps
répondit
hector
les
muffat
avaient
une
propriété

la
nôtre
je

souvent
chez
eux
le
comte
est
avec
sa
femme
et
son
beaupère
le
marquis
de
chouard
et
par
vanité
heureux
de
létonnement
de
son
cousin
il
appuya
sur
des
détails
le
marquis
était
conseiller
détat
le
comte
venait
dêtre
nommé
chambellan
de
limpératrice
fauchery
qui
avait
pris
sa
jumelle
regardait
la

une
brune
à
la
peau
blanche
potelée
avec
de
beaux
yeux
noirs
tu
présenteras
pendant
un
entracte
finitil
par
dire
je
suis
déjà
rencontré
avec
le
comte
mais
je
voudrais
aller
à
leurs
mardis
des
chuts
énergiques
partirent
des
galeries
supérieures
louverture
était
commencée
entrait
encore
des
retardataires
forçaient
des
rangées
entières
de
spectateurs
à
se
lever
les
portes
des
loges
battaient
de
grosses
voix
se
querellaient
dans
les
couloirs
et
le
bruit
des
conversations
ne
cessait
pas
pareil
au
piaillement
dune
nuée
de
moineaux
bavards
lorsque
le
jour
tombe
cétait
une
confusion
un
fouillis
de
têtes
et
de
bras
qui
sagitaient
les
uns
sasseyant
et
cherchant
leurs
aises
les
autres
sentêtant
à
rester
debout
pour
jeter
un
dernier
coup
doeil
le
cri
assis
assis
sortit
violemment
des
profondeurs
obscures
du
parterre
un
frisson
avait
couru
enfin
allait
donc
connaître
cette
fameuse
nana
dont
paris
soccupait
depuis
huit
jours
peu
à
peu
cependant
les
conversations
tombaient
mollement
avec
des
reprises
de
voix
grasses
et
au
milieu
de
ce
murmure
pâmé
de
ces
soupirs
mourants
lorchestre
éclatait
en
petites
notes
vives
une
valse
dont
le
rythme
canaille
avait
le
rire
dune
polissonnerie
le
public
chatouillé
souriait
déjà
mais
la
claque
aux
premiers
bancs
du
parterre
tapa
furieusement
des
mains
le
rideau
se
levait
tiens
dit
la
faloise
qui
causait
toujours
il
un
monsieur
avec
lucy
il
regardait
lavantscène
de
balcon
à
droite
dont
caroline
et
lucy
occupaient
le
devant
dans
le
fond
apercevait
la
face
digne
de
la
mère
de
caroline
et
le
profil
dun
grand
garçon
à
belle
chevelure
blonde
dune
tenue
irréprochable
vois
donc
répétait
la
faloise
avec
insistance
il
un
monsieur
fauchery
se
décida
à
diriger
sa
jumelle
vers
lavantscène
mais
il
se
détourna
tout
de
suite
oh
cest
labordette
murmuratil
dune
voix
insouciante
comme
si
la
présence
de
ce
monsieur
devait
être
pour
tout
le
monde
naturelle
et
sans
conséquence
derrière
eux
cria
silence
ils
durent
se
taire
maintenant
une
immobilité
frappait
la
salle
des
nappes
de
têtes
droites
et
attentives
montaient
de
lorchestre
à
lamphithéâtre
le
premier
acte
de
la
blonde
vénus
se
passait
dans
lolympe
un
olympe
de
carton
avec
des
nuées
pour
coulisses
et
le
trône
de
jupiter
à
droite
cétaient
dabord
iris
et
ganymède
aidés
dune
troupe
de
serviteurs
célestes
qui
chantaient
un
choeur
en
disposant
les
sièges
des
dieux
pour
le
conseil
de
nouveau
les
bravos
réglés
de
la
claque
partirent
tout
seuls
le
public
un
peu
dépaysé
attendait
cependant
la
faloise
avait
applaudi
clarisse
besnus
une
des
petites
femmes
de
bordenave
qui
jouait
iris
en
bleu
tendre
une
grande
écharpe
aux
sept
couleurs
nouée
à
la
taille
tu
sais
quelle
retire
sa
chemise
pour
mettre
ça
ditil
à
fauchery
de
façon
à
être
entendu
nous
avons
essayé
ça
ce
matin
voyait
sa
chemise
sous
les
bras
et
dans
le
dos
mais
un
léger
frémissement
agita
la
salle
rose
mignon
venait
dentrer
en
diane
bien
quelle
neût
ni
la
taille
ni
la
figure
du
rôle
maigre
et
noire
dune
laideur
adorable
de
gamin
parisien
elle
parut
charmante
comme
une
raillerie
même
du
personnage
son
air
dentrée
des
paroles
bêtes
à
pleurer
où
elle
se
plaignait
de
mars
qui
était
en
train
de
la
lâcher
pour
vénus
fut
chanté
avec
une
réserve
pudique
si
pleine
de
sousentendus
égrillards
que
le
public
séchauffa
le
mari
et
steiner
coude
à
coude
riaient
complaisamment
et
toute
la
salle
éclata
lorsque
prullière
cet
acteur
si
aimé
se
montra
en
général
un
mars
de
la
courtille
empanaché
dun
plumet
géant
traînant
un
sabre
qui
lui
arrivait
à
lépaule
lui
avait
assez
de
diane
elle
faisait
trop
sa
poire
alors
diane
jurait
de
le
surveiller
et
de
se
venger
le
duo
se
terminait
par
une
tyrolienne
bouffonne
que
prullière
enleva
très
drôlement
dune
voix
de
matou
irrité
il
avait
une
fatuité
amusante
de
jeune
premier
en
bonne
fortune
et
roulait
des
yeux
de
bravache
qui
soulevaient
des
rires
aigus
de
femme
dans
les
loges
puis
le
public
redevint
froid
les
scènes
suivantes
furent
trouvées
ennuyeuses
cest
à
peine
si
le
vieux
bosc
un
jupiter
imbécile
la
tête
écrasée
sous
une
couronne
immense
dérida
un
instant
le
public
lorsquil
eut
une
querelle
de
ménage
avec
junon
à
propos
du
compte
de
leur
cuisinière
le
défilé
des
dieux
neptune
pluton
minerve
et
les
autres
faillit
même
tout
gâter
simpatientait
un
murmure
inquiétant
grandissait
lentement
les
spectacteurs
se
désintéressaient
et
regardaient
dans
la
salle
lucy
riait
avec
labordette
le
comte
de
vandeuvres
allongeait
la
tête
derrière
les
fortes
épaules
de
blanche
tandis
que
fauchery
du
coin
de
loeil
examinait
les
muffat
le
comte
très
grave
comme
sil
navait
pas
compris
la
comtesse
vaguement
souriante
les
yeux
perdus
rêvant
mais
brusquement
dans
ce
malaise
les
applaudissements
de
la
claque
crépitèrent
avec
la
régularité
dun
feu
de
peloton
se
tourna
vers
la
scène
étaitce
nana
enfin
cette
nana
se
faisait
bien
attendre
cétait
une
députation
de
mortels
que
ganymède
et
iris
avaient
introduite
des
bourgeois
respectables
tous
maris
trompés
et
venant
présenter
au
maître
des
dieux
une
plainte
contre
vénus
qui
enflammait
vraiment
leurs
femmes
de
trop
dardeurs
le
choeur
sur
un
ton
dolent
et
naïf
coupé
de
silences
pleins
daveux
amusa
beaucoup
un
mot
fit
le
tour
de
la
salle
le
choeur
des
cocus
le
choeur
des
cocus
et
le
mot
devait
rester
cria
bis
les
têtes
des
choristes
étaient
drôles
leur
trouvait
une
figure
à
ça
un
gros
surtout
la
face
ronde
comme
une
lune
cependant
vulcain
arrivait
furieux
demandant
sa
femme
filée
depuis
trois
jours
le
choeur
reprenait
implorant
vulcain
le
dieu
des
cocus
ce
personnage
de
vulcain
était
joué
par
fontan
un
comique
dun
talent
canaille
et
original
qui
avait
un
déhanchement
dune
fantaisie
folle
en
forgeron
de
village
la
perruque
flambante
les
bras
nus
tatoués
de
coeurs
percés
de
flèches
une
voix
de
femme
laissa
échapper
très
haut
ah
quil
est
laid
et
toutes
riaient
en
applaudissant
une
scène
ensuite
sembla
interminable
jupiter
nen
finissait
pas
dassembler
le
conseil
des
dieux
pour
lui
soumettre
la
requête
des
maris
trompés
et
toujours
pas
de
nana
gardait
donc
nana
pour
le
baisser
du
rideau
une
attente
si
prolongée
avait
fini
par
irriter
le
public
les
murmures
recommençaient
ça
va
mal
dit
mignon
radieux
à
steiner
un
joli
attrapage
vous
allez
voir
ce
moment
les
nuées
au
fond
sécartèrent
et
vénus
parut
nana
très
grande
très
forte
pour
ses
dixhuit
ans
dans
sa
tunique
blanche
de
déesse
ses
longs
cheveux
blonds
simplement
dénoués
sur
les
épaules
descendit
vers
la
rampe
avec
un
aplomb
tranquille
en
riant
au
public
et
elle
entama
son
grand
air
lorsque
vénus
rôde
le
soir
dès
le
second
vers
se
regardait
dans
la
salle
étaitce
une
plaisanterie
quelque
gageure
de
bordenave
jamais
navait
entendu
une
voix
aussi
fausse
menée
avec
moins
de
méthode
son
directeur
la
jugeait
bien
elle
chantait
comme
une
seringue
et
elle
ne
savait
même
pas
se
tenir
en
scène
elle
jetait
les
mains
en
avant
dans
un
balancement
de
tout
son
corps
quon
trouva
peu
convenable
et
disgracieux
des
oh
oh
sélevaient
déjà
du
parterre
et
des
petites
places
sifflotait
lorsquune
voix
de
jeune
coq
en
train
de
muer
aux
fauteuils
dorchestre
lança
avec
conviction
très
chic
toute
la
salle
regarda
cétait
le
chérubin
léchappé
de
collège
ses
beaux
yeux
écarquillés
sa
face
blonde
enflammée
par
la
vue
de
nana
quand
il
vit
le
monde
se
tourner
vers
lui
il
devint
très
rouge
davoir
ainsi
parlé
haut
sans
le
vouloir
daguenet
son
voisin
lexaminait
avec
un
sourire
le
public
riait
comme
désarmé
et
ne
songeant
plus
à
siffler
tandis
que
les
jeunes
messieurs
en
gants
blancs
empoignés
eux
aussi
par
le
galbe
de
nana
se
pâmaient
applaudissaient
cest
ça
très
bien
bravo
nana
cependant
en
voyant
rire
la
salle
sétait
mise
à
rire
la
gaieté
redoubla
elle
était
drôle
tout
de
même
cette
belle
fille
son
rire
lui
creusait
un
amour
de
petit
trou
dans
le
menton
elle
attendait
pas
gênée
familière
entrant
tout
de
suite
de
plainpied
avec
le
public
ayant
lair
de
dire
ellemême
dun
clignement
dyeux
quelle
navait
pas
de
talent
pour
deux
liards
mais
que
ça
ne
faisait
rien
quelle
avait
autre
chose
et
après
avoir
adressé
au
chef
dorchestre
un
geste
qui
signifiait
allonsy
mon
bonhomme
elle
commença
le
second
couplet
minuit
cest
vénus
qui
passe
cétait
toujours
la
même
voix
vinaigrée
mais
à
présent
elle
grattait
si
bien
le
public
au
bon
endroit
quelle
lui
tirait
par
moments
un
léger
frisson
nana
avait
gardé
son
rire
qui
éclairait
sa
petite
bouche
rouge
et
luisait
dans
ses
grands
yeux
dun
bleu
très
clair
certains
vers
un
peu
vifs
une
friandise
retroussait
son
nez
dont
les
ailes
roses
battaient
pendant
quune
flamme
passait
sur
ses
joues
elle
continuait
à
se
balancer
ne
sachant
faire
que
ça
et
ne
trouvait
plus
ça
vilain
du
tout
au
contraire
les
hommes
braquaient
leurs
jumelles
comme
elle
terminait
le
couplet
la
voix
lui
manqua
complètement
elle
comprit
quelle
nirait
jamais
au
bout
alors
sans
sinquiéter
elle
donna
un
coup
de
hanche
qui
dessina
une
rondeur
sous
la
mince
tunique
tandis
que
la
taille
pliée
la
gorge
renversée
elle
tendait
les
bras
des
applaudissements
éclatèrent
tout
de
suite
elle
sétait
tournée
remontant
faisant
voir
sa
nuque
où
des
cheveux
roux
mettaient
comme
une
toison
de
bête
et
les
applaudissements
devinrent
furieux
la
fin
de
lacte
fut
plus
froide
vulcain
voulait
gifler
vénus
les
dieux
tenaient
conseil
et
décidaient
quils
iraient
procéder
à
une
enquête
sur
la
terre
avant
de
satisfaire
les
maris
trompés
cétait
là
que
diane
surprenant
des
mots
tendres
entre
vénus
et
mars
jurait
de
ne
pas
les
quitter
des
yeux
pendant
le
voyage
il
avait
aussi
une
scène
où
lamour
joué
par
une
gamine
de
douze
ans
répondait
à
toutes
les
questions
oui
maman
non
maman
dun
ton
pleurnicheur
les
doigts
dans
le
nez
puis
jupiter
avec
la
sévérité
dun
maître
qui
se
fâche
enfermait
lamour
dans
un
cabinet
noir
en
lui
donnant
à
conjuguer
vingt
fois
le
verbe
jaime
goûta
davantage
le
finale
un
choeur
que
la
troupe
et
lorchestre
enlevèrent
très
brillamment
mais
le
rideau
baissé
la
claque
tâcha
vainement
dobtenir
un
rappel
tout
le
monde
debout
se
dirigeait
déjà
vers
les
portes
piétinait
se
bousculait
serré
entre
les
rangs
des
fauteuils
échangeant
ses
impressions
un
même
mot
courait
cest
idiot
un
critique
disait
quil
faudrait
joliment
couper
làdedans
la
pièce
importait
peu
dailleurs
causait
surtout
de
nana
fauchery
et
la
faloise
sortis
des
premiers
se
rencontrèrent
dans
le
couloir
de
lorchestre
avec
steiner
et
mignon
étouffait
dans
ce
boyau
étroit
et
écrasé
comme
une
galerie
de
mine
que
des
lampes
à
gaz
éclairaient
ils
restèrent
un
instant
au
pied
de
lescalier
de
droite
protégés
par
le
retour
de
la
rampe
les
spectateurs
des
petites
places
descendaient
avec
un
bruit
continu
de
gros
souliers
le
flot
des
habits
noirs
passait
tandis
quune
ouvreuse
faisait
tous
ses
efforts
pour
protéger
contre
les
poussées
une
chaise
sur
laquelle
elle
avait
empilé
des
vêtements
mais
je
la
connais
cria
steiner
dès
quil
aperçut
fauchery
pour
sûr
je
lai
vue
quelque
part
au
casino
je
crois
et
elle
est
fait
ramasser
tant
elle
était
soûle
moi
je
ne
sais
plus
au
juste
dit
le
journaliste
je
suis
comme
vous
je
lai
certainement
rencontrée
il
baissa
la
voix
et
ajouta
en
riant
chez
la
tricon
peutêtre
parbleu
dans
un
sale
endroit
déclara
mignon
qui
semblait
exaspéré
cest
dégoûtant
que
le
public
accueille
comme
ça
la
première
salope
venue
il
n
aura
bientôt
plus
dhonnêtes
femmes
au
théâtre
oui
je
finirai
par
défendre
à
rose
de
jouer
fauchery
ne
put
sempêcher
de
sourire
cependant
la
dégringolade
des
gros
souliers
sur
les
marches
ne
cessait
pas
un
petit
homme
en
casquette
disait
dune
voix
traînante
oh
là
là
elle
est
rien
boulotte
de
quoi
manger
dans
le
couloir
deux
jeunes
gens
frisés
au
petit
fer
très
corrects
avec
leurs
cols
cassés
se
querellaient
lun
répétait
le
mot
infecte
infecte
sans
donner
de
raison
lautre
répondait
par
le
mot
épatante
épatante
dédaigneux
aussi
de
tout
argument
la
faloise
la
trouvait
très
bien
il
risqua
seulement
quelle
serait
mieux
si
elle
cultivait
sa
voix
alors
steiner
qui
nécoutait
plus
parut
séveiller
en
sursaut
il
fallait
attendre
dailleurs
peutêtre
que
tout
se
gâterait
aux
actes
suivants
le
public
avait
montré
de
la
complaisance
mais
certainement
il
nétait
pas
encore
empoigné
mignon
jurait
que
la
pièce
ne
finirait
pas
et
comme
fauchery
et
la
faloise
les
quittaient
pour
monter
au
foyer
il
prit
le
bras
de
steiner
il
se
poussa
contre
son
épaule
en
lui
soufflant
dans
loreille
mon
cher
vous
allez
voir
le
costume
de
femme
au
second
acte
il
est
dun
cochon
en
haut
dans
le
foyer
trois
lustres
de
cristal
brûlaient
avec
une
vive
lumière
les
deux
cousins
hésitèrent
un
instant
la
porte
vitrée
rabattue
laissait
voir
dun
bout
à
lautre
de
la
galerie
une
houle
de
têtes
que
deux
courants
emportaient
dans
un
continuel
remous
pourtant
ils
entrèrent
cinq
ou
six
groupes
dhommes
causant
très
fort
et
gesticulant
sentêtaient
au
milieu
des
bourrades
les
autres
marchaient
par
files
tournant
sur
leurs
talons
qui
battaient
le
parquet
ciré
droite
et
à
gauche
entre
des
colonnes
de
marbre
jaspé
des
femmes
assises
sur
des
banquettes
de
velours
rouge
regardaient
le
flot
passer
dun
air
las
comme
alanguies
par
la
chaleur
et
derrière
elles
dans
de
hautes
glaces
voyait
leurs
chignons
au
fond
devant
le
buffet
un
homme
à
gros
ventre
buvait
un
verre
de
sirop
mais
fauchery
pour
respirer
était
allé
sur
le
balcon
la
faloise
qui
étudiait
des
photographies
dactrices
dans
des
cadres
alternant
avec
les
glaces
entre
les
colonnes
finit
par
le
suivre
venait
déteindre
la
rampe
de
gaz
au
fronton
du
théâtre
il
faisait
noir
et
très
frais
sur
le
balcon
qui
leur
sembla
vide
seul
un
jeune
homme
enveloppé
dombre
accoudé
à
la
balustrade
de
pierre
dans
la
baie
de
droite
fumait
une
cigarette
dont
la
braise
luisait
fauchery
reconnut
daguenet
ils
se
serrèrent
la
main
que
faitesvous
donc
là
mon
cher
demanda
le
journaliste
vous
vous
cachez
dans
les
petits
coins
vous
qui
ne

pas
lorchestre
les
jours
de

mais

répondit
daguenet
alors
fauchery
pour
lembarrasser
eh
bien
que
pensezvous
de
la
débutante
la
traite
assez
mal
dans
les
couloirs
oh
murmura
daguenet
des
hommes
dont
elle
naura
pas
voulu
ce
fut
tout
son
jugement
sur
le
talent
de
nana
la
faloise
se
penchait
regardant
le
boulevard
en
face
les
fenêtres
dun
hôtel
et
dun
cercle
étaient
vivement
éclairées
tandis
que
sur
le
trottoir
une
masse
noire
de
consommateurs
occupaient
les
tables
du

malgré

avancée
la

à

continuellement
du

des

attendaient
cinq
minutes
avant
de
pouvoir
traverser
tant
la
queue
des
voitures
sallongeait
quel
mouvement
quel
bruit
répétait
la
faloise
que
paris
étonnait
encore
une
sonnerie

longuement
le

dans

le
rideau
était
levé
quon
rentrait
par

au

de
la
mauvaise
humeur
des
spectateurs
déjà
assis
chacun
reprenait
sa
place
le
visage
animé
et
de
nouveau
attentif
le
premier
regard
de
la
faloise
fut
pour
gaga
mais
il
demeura
étonné
en
voyant

tout

avec
le

dans
un
bastringue
de

à
la
boulenoire
en
plein

gras
des
chienlits
chantaient
une
ronde
quils
accompagnaient
au

en

des

cette
échappée
canaille
à
laquelle
ne
sattendait
point
égaya
tellement
quon
bissa
la
ronde
et
cétait
là
que
la
bande
des

égarée
par
iris
qui
se
vantait
faussement
de

venait
procéder
à
son
enquête
ils
sétaient
déguisés

les

devinrent
scandaleux
lorsquon
vit

vêtu
dune

coiffé
dune
haute

ballonnée
des
accrochecoeurs
collés
aux

traînant

si
bruyamment
que
caroline

la
fit

sauvée

tapé
la

une
farce
et
larmée
une
rigolade
quand

tout
dun
coup

dune
petite
blanchisseuse

mit
à
pincer

au

des

de

de

de

que
tout
de

elle
gagna
la

en
oublia

avec
un
bourrelet

et
une
courte

de

sur

de

une
toutepuissance
de

dont
le

se
grisait
dès
ce
second
acte
tout
lui
fut
permis
se
tenir
mal
en

ne
pas
chanter
une
note
juste
manquer
de

elle
navait
qu
à
se
tourner
et
à

pour
enlever
les
bravos
quand
elle
donnait

au

du

et
la
musique
semblait
faite
pour
sa
voix
faubourienne
une
musique
de

un
retour
de

avec
des
éternuements
de

à

qui
sécriait

mon

le

ne
paraissait
pas
bien
clair
lenquête
aboutissait
à
un
galop
final
après
lequel
jupiter
essoufflé
en
nage
sans
couronne
déclarait
que
les
petites
femmes
de
la
terre
étaient
délicieuses
et
que
les
hommes
avaient
tous
les
torts
le
rideau
tombait
lorsque
dominant
les

des
voix
crièrent
violemment
tous
tous
alors
le

se
releva
les

reparurent
se
tenant
par

répondit
fauchery
nous
descendrons
ensuite
mais
il
nétait
pas
facile
darriver
aux
loges
de
balcon
dans
le
couloir
en
haut
sécrasait
pour
avancer
au
milieu
des
groupes
il
fallait
seffacer
se
glisser
en
jouant
des
coudes
adossé
sous
une
lampe
de
cuivre
où
brûlait
un
jet
de
gaz
le
gros
critique
jugeait
la
pièce
devant
un
cercle
attentif
des
gens
au
passage
se
le
nommaient
à
demivoix
il
avait
ri
pendant
tout
lacte
cétait
la
rumeur
des
couloirs
pourtant
il
se
montrait
très
sévère
parlait
du
goût
et
de
la
morale
plus
loin
le
critique
aux
lèvres
minces
était
plein
dune
bienveillance
qui
avait
un
arrièregoût
gâté
comme
du
lait
tourné
à
laigre
fauchery
fouillait
les
loges
dun
coup
doeil
par
les
baies
rondes
taillées
dans
les
portes
mais
le
comte
de
vandeuvres
larrêta
en
le
questionnant
et
quand
il
sut
que
les
deux
cousins
allaient
saluer
les
muffat
il
leur
indiqua
la
loge
doù
justement
il
sortait
puis
se
penchant
à

fauchery
je
disais
bien
que
je
la
connaissais
la
faloise
présenta
son
cousin
au
comte
muffat
de
beuville
qui
se
montra
très
froid
mais
au
nom
de
fauchery
la
comtesse
avait
levé
la
tête
et
elle
complimenta
le
chroniqueur
sur
ses
articles
du
figaro
dune
phrase
discrète
accoudée
sur
le
velours
de
la
rampe
elle
se
tournait
à

dans
un
joli
mouvement

un
instant
la
conversation

sur
lexposition

très
beau

le
comte
dont
la
face
carrée
et
régulière
gardait
une
gravité
officielle

émerveillé

quon

un
jour
quil

allé
làbas
chercher
un
sujet
darticle
la
comtesse
souriait
elle
regardait
par
moments
dans
la
salle
levant
un
de
ses
bras
ganté
de
blanc
jusquau
coude
séventant
dune
main
ralentie
la
salle
presque
vide
sommeillait
quelques
messieurs
à
lorchestre
avaient
étalé
des
journaux
des
femmes
recevaient
très
à
laise
comme
chez
elles
il
n
avait
plus
quun
chuchotement
de
bonne
compagnie
sous
le
lustre
dont
la
clarté
sadoucissait
dans
la
fine
poussière
soulevée
par
le

de

pour

le

une
dignité
si
glacée
quon
laurait

à
quelque
séance
du
corps
législatif
il
dit
simplement
pour
expliquer
leur
présence
que
son
beaupère
aimait
le
théâtre
la
porte
de
la
loge
avait
dû
rester
ouverte
le
marquis
de
chouard
qui
était
sorti
afin
de
laisser
sa
place
aux
visiteurs
redressait
sa
haute
taille
de
vieillard
la
face
molle
et
blanche
sous
un
chapeau
à
larges
bords
suivant
de
ses
yeux
troubles
les
femmes
qui
passaient
dès
que
la
comtesse
eut
fait
son
invitation
fauchery
prit
congé
sentant
quil
serait
inconvenant
de
parler
de
la
pièce
la
faloise
sortit
le
dernier
de
la
loge
il
venait
dapercevoir
dans

le
blond
labordette
carrément
installé
sentretenant

près
avec

au
fond
devant
la
porte
de
son
avantscène

làdedans

et
elle
occupait
la
largeur
du
corridor
en
compagnie
de

et
de
sa

des
pralines
une
ouvreuse

maternellement
avec

le
journaliste
il
était
gentil
il
montait
voir
les
autres
femmes
et
il
ne
venait
seulement
pas
demander
si
elles
avaient
soif
puis
lâchant
ce
sujet
tu
sais
mon
cher
moi
je
trouve
nana
très
bien
elle
voulait
quil
restât
dans
lavantscène
pour
le
dernier
acte
mais
lui
séchappa
en
promettant
de
les
prendre
à
la
sortie
en
bas
devant
le
théâtre
fauchery
et
la
faloise
allumèrent
des
cigarettes
un
rassemblement
barrait
le
trottoir
une
queue
dhommes
descendus
du
perron
et
respirant
la
fraîcheur
de
la
nuit
au
milieu
du
ronflement
ralenti
du
boulevard
cependant
mignon
venait
dentraîner
steiner
au
café
des
variétés
voyant
le
succès
de

il
sétait
mis
à
parler

enthousiasme
tout
en
surveillant
le
banquier
du
coin
de
loeil
il
le
connaissait
deux
fois
il
lavait
aidé
à
tromper
rose
puis
le
caprice
passé
lavait
ramené
repentant
et
fidèle
dans
le
café
les
consommateurs
trop
nombreux
se
serraient
autour
des
tables
de
marbre
quelquesuns
buvaient
debout
précipitamment
et
les
larges
glaces
reflétaient
à
linfini
cette
cohue
de
têtes
agrandissaient
démesurément
létroite
salle
avec
ses
trois
lustres
ses
banquettes
de
moleskine
son
escalier
tournant
drapé
de
rouge
steiner
alla
se
placer
à
une
table
de
la
première
salle
ouverte
sur
le
boulevard
dont
avait
enlevé
les
portes
un
peu
tôt
pour
la
saison

la
faloise

retint

un
bock
avec

mais
une
idée
le
préoccupait
il
voulait
faire
jeter
un
bouquet
à
nana
enfin
il
appela
un
garçon
du
café
quil
nommait
familièrement
auguste
mignon
qui
écoutait
le
regarda
dun
oeil
si
clair
quil
se
troubla
en

de
la
salle
la
nuque
appuyée
contre
le
cadre
dune
glace
une
fille
de
dixhuit
ans
au
plus
se
tenait
immobile
devant
un
verre
vide
comme
engourdie
par
une
longue
et
vaine
attente
sous
les
frisures
naturelles
de
ses
beaux
cheveux
cendrés
elle
avait
une
figure
de
vierge
aux
yeux
de
velours
doux
et
candides
et
elle
portait
une
robe
de
soie
verte
déteinte
avec
un
chapeau
rond
que
des
gifles
avaient
défoncé
la
fraîcheur
de
la
nuit

rendait
toute
blanche

murmura
fauchery
en
lapercevant

faloise

questionna

haussant
la
voix

tranquillement
sans

les
quatre
hommes
charmés
se
mirent
à
rire
mignon
assurait
quon
navait
pas
besoin
de
se
presser
il
fallait
vingt
minutes
pour
poser
le
décor
du
troisième
acte
mais
les
deux
cousins
qui
avaient
bu
leur
bière
voulurent
remonter
le
froid
les
prenait
alors
mignon
resté
seul
avec

remarquèrent
aux
secondes
loges
une
jolie
femme
mise
avec
modestie
elle
était
en
compagnie
dun
monsieur
dair
sérieux
un
chef
de
bureau
au
ministère
de

que
la
faloise
connaissait
pour
lavoir
rencontré
chez

muffat
quant
à

il
croyait
quelle
se
nommait
madame
robert
une
femme
honnête
qui
avait
un
amant
pas

et
toujours
un
homme
respectable
mais
ils
durent
se
tourner
daguenet

souriait
maintenant
que
nana
avait
réussi
il
ne
se
cachait
plus
il
venait
de
triompher
dans
les
couloirs
son
côté
le
jeune
échappé
de

pas
quitté
son
fauteuil
dans
la
stupeur
dadmiration
où
nana
le
plongeait
cétait
ça
cétait
la
femme
et
il
devenait
très
rouge
il
mettait
et
retirait
machinalement
ses
gants
puis
comme
son
voisin
avait
causé
de
nana
il
osa
linterroger
pardon
monsieur
cette
dame
qui
joue
estce
que
vous
la
connaissez

un
peu
murmura
daguenet
surpris
et
hésitant
alors
vous

son
adresse

question
tombait
si
crûment
adressée
à
lui
quil
eut
envie
de
répondre
par
une
gifle
non
ditil
dun
ton
sec
et
il
tourna
le
dos
le
blondin
comprit
quil
venait
de
commettre
quelque
inconvenance
il
rougit
davantage
et
resta
effaré
frappait
les
trois
coups
des
ouvreuses
sentêtaient
à
rendre
les
vêtements
chargées
de
pelisses
et
de
paletots
au

avec
le

feindre
un
voyage
pour

et
à

puis
à

trouvaitelle
seule
que

arrivait
un
frisson
remua
la
salle
nana
était
nue
elle
était
nue
avec
une
tranquille
audace
certaine
de
la
toutepuissance
de
sa
chair
une
simple
gaze

ses
épaules
rondes

gorge
damazone
dont
les
pointes
roses
se
tenaient
levées
et
rigides
comme

dans
un
balancement
voluptueux

lorsque

de
ses

il
n

personne
ne
riait
plus
les
faces
des
hommes
sérieuses
se
tendaient
avec
le
nez
aminci
la
bouche
irritée
et
sans
salive
un
vent
semblait
avoir
passé
très
doux
chargé
dune
sourde
menace
tout
dun
coup
dans
la
bonne
enfant
la
femme
se
dressait
inquiétante
apportant
le
coup
de
folie
de
son
sexe
ouvrant
linconnu
du

souriait
toujours
mais
dun
sourire
aigu
de
mangeuse
dhommes
fichtre
dit
simplement

à
la
faloise
mars
cependant
accourait
au
rendezvous
avec
son
plumet
et
se
trouvait
entre
les
deux
déesses
il
avait
là
une
scène
que
prullière
joua
finement
caressé
par
diane
qui
voulait
tenter
sur
lui
un
dernier
effort
avant
de
le
livrer
à
vulcain
cajolé
par
vénus
que
la
présence
de
sa
rivale
stimulait
il
sabandonnait
à
ces
douceurs
dun
air
béat
de
coq
en
pâte
puis
un
grand
trio
terminait
la
scène
et
ce
fut
alors
quune
ouvreuse
parut
dans
la
loge
de
lucy
stewart
et
jeta
deux
énormes
bouquets
de
lilas

pendant
que

ramassait
les
bouquets
une
partie
de

tourna
en
souriant
vers
la
baignoire
occupée
par
steiner
et
mignon
le
banquier
le
sang
au
visage
avait
de
petits
mouvements
convulsifs
du
menton
comme
sil
eût
éprouvé
un
embarras
dans
la
gorge
ce
qui
suivit
acheva
dempoigner
la
salle
diane
sen
était
allée
furieuse
tout
de

assise
sur
un

de

lattirait
lorsque

se
livrant
à
une
mimique
de
fureur
cocasse
exagérant
le
masque
dun
époux
outragé
qui
surprend
sa
femme
en
flagrant
délit
parut
dans
le
fond
de
la
grotte
il
tenait
le
fameux
filet
aux
mailles
de
fer
un
instant
il
le
balança
pareil
à
un
pêcheur
qui
va
jeter
un
coup
dépervier
et
par
un
truc
ingénieux
vénus
et
mars
furent
pris
au
piège
le
filet
les
enveloppa
les
immobilisa
dans
leur
posture
damants
heureux
un
murmure
grandit
comme
un
soupir
qui
se
gonflait
quelques
mains
battirent
toutes
les
jumelles
étaient
fixées
sur
vénus
peu
à
peu
nana
avait
pris
possession
du
public
et
maintenant
chaque
homme
la
subissait
le
rut
qui
montait
delle
ainsi
que
dune
bête
en
folie
sétait
épandu
toujours
davantage
emplissant
la
salle
cette
heure
ses
moindres
mouvements
soufflaient
le
désir
elle
retournait
la
chair
dun
geste
de
son
petit
doigt
des
dos
sarrondissaient
vibrant
comme
si
des
archets
invisibles
se
fussent
promenés
sur
les
muscles
des
nuques
montraient
des
poils
follets
qui
senvolaient
sous
des
haleines
tièdes
et
errantes
venues
ne
savait
de
quelle
bouche
de
femme
fauchery
voyait
devant
lui
léchappé
de
collège
que
la
passion
soulevait
de
son
fauteuil
il
eut
la
curiosité
de
regarder
le
comte
de
vandeuvres
très
pâle
les
lèvres
pincées
le
gros
steiner
dont
la
face
apoplectique
crevait
labordette
lorgnant
dun
air
étonné
de
maquignon
qui
admire
une
jument
parfaite
daguenet
dont
les
oreilles
saignaient
et
remuaient
de
jouissance
puis
un
instinct
lui
fit
jeter
un
coup
doeil
en
arrière
et
il
resta
étonné
de
ce
quil
aperçut
dans
la
loge
des
muffat
derrière
la
comtesse
blanche
et
sérieuse
le
comte
se
haussait
béant
la
face
marbrée
de
taches
rouges
tandis
que
près
de
lui
dans
lombre
les
yeux
troubles
du
marquis
de
chouard
étaient
devenus
deux
yeux
de
chat
phosphorescents
pailletés
dor
suffoquait
les
chevelures
salourdissaient
sur
les
têtes
en
sueur
depuis
trois
heures
quon
était
là
les
haleines
avaient
chauffé
lair
dune
odeur
humaine
dans
le
flamboiement
du
gaz
les
poussières
en
suspension
sépaississaient
immobiles
audessous
du
lustre
la
salle
entière
vacillait
glissait
à
un
vertige
lasse
et
excitée
prise
de
ces
désirs
ensommeillés
de
minuit
qui
balbutient
au
fond
des
alcôves
et
nana
en
face
de
ce
public
pâmé
de
ces
quinze
cents
personnes
entassées
noyées
dans
laffaissement
et
le
détraquement
nerveux
dune
fin
de
spectacle
restait
victorieuse
avec
sa
chair
de
marbre
son
sexe
assez
fort
pour
détruire
tout
ce
monde
et
nen
être
pas
entamé
la
pièce
sacheva
aux
appels
triomphants
de
vulcain
tout
lolympe
défilait
devant
les
amoureux
avec
des
oh
et
des
ah
de
stupéfaction
et
de
gaillardise
jupiter
disait
mon
fils
je
vous
trouve
léger
de
nous
appeler
pour
voir
ça
puis
un
revirement
avait
lieu
en
faveur
de
vénus
le
choeur
des
cocus
introduit
de
nouveau
par
iris
suppliait
le
maître
des
dieux
de
ne
pas
donner
suite
à
sa
requête
depuis
que
les
femmes
demeuraient
au
logis
la
vie
devenait
impossible
pour
les
hommes
ils
aimaient
mieux
être
trompés
et
contents
ce
qui
était
la
morale
de
la
comédie
alors
délivrait
vénus
vulcain
obtenait
une
séparation
de
corps
mars
se
remettait
avec
diane
jupiter
pour
avoir
la
paix
dans
son
ménage
envoyait
sa
petite
blanchisseuse
dans
une
constellation
et
lon
tirait
enfin
lamour
de
son
cachot
où
il
avait
fait
des
cocottes
au
lieu
de
conjuguer
le
verbe
aimer
la
toile
tomba
sur
une
apothéose
le
choeur
des
cocus
agenouillé
chantant
un
hymne
de
reconnaissance
à
vénus
souriante
et
grandie
dans
sa
souveraine
nudité
les
spectateurs
déjà
debout
gagnaient
les
portes
nomma
les
auteurs
et
il
eut
deux
rappels
au
milieu
dun
tonnerre
de
bravos
le
cri
nana
nana
avait
roulé
furieusement
puis
la
salle
nétait
pas
encore
vide

devint
noire
la
rampe
séteignit
le
lustre
baissa
de
longues
housses
de
toile
grise
glissèrent
des
avantscènes
enveloppèrent
les
dorures
des
galeries
et
cette
salle
si
chaude
si
bruyante
tomba
dun
coup
à
un
lourd
sommeil
pendant
quune
odeur
de
moisi
et
de
poussière
montait
au
bord
de
sa
loge
attendant
que
la
foule
se
fût
écoulée
la
comtesse

toute
droite
emmitouflée
de
fourrures

dans

hâtés
pour
assister
à

du

que
du
double

lentement
deux
interminables
queues
descendaient
régulières

compactes

entraîné
par

avait
filé
des

le
comte
de

partit
avec
blanche
de

à
son

un
instant
gaga
et
sa

semblèrent
embarrassées
mais

sempressa
daller
leur
chercher
une

referma
galamment
la
portière
sur

le
frôler
de
ses
jupes
mais
lui
désespéré
refusa
brutalement
puis
disparut
au
milieu
de
la
foule
avec
des
larmes
de
désir
et
dimpuissance
dans
les
yeux
des
spectateurs
allumaient
des
cigares

en
fredonnant
lorsque

était
remontée
devant

ce
matin

sur
le
moricaud

une
histoire
madame
ne
pas
prévenue
je
ne

pas
savoir
murmura
zoé
quand
madame
changera
ses
jours
elle
fera
bien
de
mavertir
pour
que
je
sache
alors
le
vieux
grigou
nest
plus
pour
le
mardi
elles
appelaient
ainsi
entre
elles
sans
rire
de
ces
noms
de
vieux
grigou
et
de
moricaud
les
deux
hommes
qui
payaient
un
commerçant
du
faubourg
saintdenis
de
tempérament
économe
et
un
valaque
un
prétendu
comte
dont
largent
toujours
très
irrégulier
avait
une
étrange
odeur
daguenet
sétait
fait
donner
les
lendemains
du
vieux
grigou
comme
le
commerçant
devait
être
le
matin
à
sa
maison
dès
huit
heures
le
jeune
homme
guettait
son
départ
de
la
cuisine
de
zoé
et
prenait
sa
place
toute
chaude
jusqu
à
dix
heures
puis
luimême
allait
à
ses
affaires
nana
et
lui
trouvaient
ça
très
commode
tant
pis
ditelle
je
lui
écrirai
cette
aprèsmidi
et
sil

reçoit
pas
lettre
demain
vous
lempêcherez
dentrer
cependant
zoé
marchait
doucement
dans
la
chambre
elle
parlait
du
grand
succès
de
la
veille
madame
venait
de
montrer
tant
de
talent
elle
chantait
si
bien
ah
madame
pouvait
être
tranquille
à
cette
heure
nana
le
coude
dans
loreiller
ne
répondait
que
par
des
hochements
de
tête
sa
chemise
avait
glissé
ses
cheveux
dénoués
embroussaillés
roulaient
sur
ses
épaules
sans
doute
murmuratelle
devenue
rêveuse
mais
comment
faire
pour
attendre
je
vais
avoir
toutes
sortes
dembêtements
aujourdhui
voyons
estce
que
le
concierge
est
encore
monté
ce
matin
alors
toutes
deux
causèrent
sérieusement
devait
trois
termes
le
propriétaire
parlait
de
saisie
puis
il
avait
une
débâcle
de
créanciers
un
loueur
de
voitures
une
lingère
un
couturier
un
charbonnier
dautres
encore
qui
venaient
chaque
jour
sinstaller
sur
une
banquette
de
lantichambre
le
charbonnier
surtout
se
montrait
terrible
il
criait
dans
lescalier
mais
le
gros
chagrin
de
nana
était
son
petit
louis
un
enfant
quelle
avait
eu
à
seize
ans
et
quelle
laissait
chez
sa
nourrice
dans
un
village
aux
environs
de
rambouillet
cette
femme
réclamait
trois
cents
francs
pour
rendre
louiset
prise
dune
crise
damour
maternel
depuis
sa
dernière
visite
à
lenfant
nana
se
désespérait
de
ne
pouvoir
réaliser
un
projet
passé
à
lidée
fixe
payer
la
nourrice
et
mettre
le
petit
chez
sa
tante
madame
lerat
aux
batignolles
où
elle
irait
le
voir
tant
quelle
voudrait
cependant
la
femme
de
chambre
insinuait
que
madame
aurait
dû
confier
ses
besoins
au
vieux
grigou
eh
je
lui
ai
tout
dit
cria
nana
il
répondu
quil
avait
de
trop
fortes
échéances
il
ne
sort
pas
de
ses
mille
francs
par
mois
le
moricaud
est
pané
en
ce
moment
je
crois
quil
perdu
au
jeu
quant
à
ce
pauvre
mimi
il
aurait
grand
besoin
quon
lui
en
prêtât
un
coup
de
baisse
l
nettoyé
il
ne
peut
seulement
plus
mapporter
des
fleurs
elle
parlait
de
daguenet
dans
labandon
du
réveil
elle
navait
pas
de
secret
pour
zoé
celleci
habituée
à
de
pareilles
confidences
les
recevait
avec
une
sympathie
respectueuse
puisque
madame
daignait
lui
causer
de
ses
affaires
elle
se
permettrait
de
dire
ce
quelle
pensait
dabord
elle
aimait
beaucoup
madame
elle
avait
quitté
exprès
madame
blanche
et
dieu
sait
si
madame
blanche
faisait
des
pieds
et
des
mains
pour
la
ravoir
les
places
ne
manquaient
pas
elle
était
assez
connue
mais
elle
serait
restée
chez
madame
même
dans
la
gêne
parce
quelle
croyait
à
lavenir
de
madame
et
elle
finit
par
préciser
ses
conseils
quand
était
jeune
faisait
des
bêtises
cette
fois
il
fallait
ouvrir
loeil
car
les
hommes
ne
songeaient
qu
à
la
plaisanterie
oh
il
allait
en
arriver
madame
naurait
quun
mot
à
dire
pour
calmer
ses
créanciers
et
pour
trouver
largent
dont
elle
avait
besoin
tout
ça
ne
donne
pas
trois
cents
francs
répétait
nana
en
enfonçant
les
doigts
dans
les
mèches
folles
de
son
chignon
il
faut
trois
cents
francs
aujourdhui
tout
de
suite
cest
bête
de
ne
pas
connaître
quelquun
qui
vous
donne
trois
cents
francs
elle
cherchait
elle
aurait
envoyé
à
rambouillet
madame
lerat
quelle
attendait
justement
le
matin
son
caprice
contrarié
lui
gâtait
le
triomphe
de
la
veille
parmi
tous
ces
hommes
qui
lavaient
acclamée
dire
quil
ne
sen
trouverait
pas
un
pour
lui
apporter
quinze
louis
puis
ne
pouvait
accepter
de
largent
comme
ça
mon
dieu
quelle
était
malheureuse
et
elle
revenait
toujours
à
son
bébé
il
avait
des
yeux
bleus
de
chérubin
il
bégayait
maman
dune
voix
si
drôle
que
cétait
à
mourir
de
rire
mais
au
même
instant
la
sonnerie
électrique
de
la
porte
dentrée
se
fit
entendre
avec
sa
vibration
rapide
et
tremblée
zoé
revint
murmurant
dun
air
confidentiel
cest
une
femme
elle
avait
vu
vingt
fois
cette
femme
seulement
elle
affectait
de
ne
jamais
la
reconnaître
et
dignorer
quelles

ses
relations
avec
les
dames
dans

une
vieille
dame
de
haute
taille
portant
des
anglaises
ayant
la
tournure
dune
comtesse
qui
court
les
avoués
puis
elle
seffaça
elle
disparut
sans
bruit
du
mouvement
souple
de
couleuvre
dont
elle
sortait
dune
pièce
lorsquun
monsieur
venait
dailleurs
elle
aurait
pu
rester
la
tricon

sassit

quun
échange
de
paroles

temps
sec
par

était
bon
de

elle
avait
encore
quatre
ou
cinq
personnes
à
voir
et
elle
sen
alla
en
consultant
un
petit
calepin
restée
seule
nana
parut
soulagée
un
léger
frisson
passait
sur
ses
épaules
elle
se
refourra
dans
le
lit
chaud
mollement
avec
une
paresse
de
chatte
frileuse
peu
à
peu
ses
yeux
se
fermèrent
elle
souriait
à
lidée
dhabiller
louiset
gentiment
le
lendemain
tandis
que
dans
le
sommeil
qui
la
reprenait
son
rêve
fiévreux
de
toute
la
nuit
un
roulement
prolongé
de
bravos
revenait
comme
une
basse
continue
et
berçait
sa
lassitude
onze
heures
lorsque
zoé
fit
entrer
madame
lerat
dans
la
chambre
nana
dormait
encore
mais
elle
séveilla
au
bruit
et
tout
de
suite
cest

reprit
la
jeune
femme
qui
sétirait
la
gorge
haute
tu

puis
nous
verrons
zoé
apportait
un
peignoir
madame
murmuratelle
le
coiffeur

là
mais
nana
ne
voulut
point
passer
dans
le
cabinet
de
toilette
elle
cria
ellemême
entrez
francis
un
monsieur
mis
correctement

la
porte
il
salua
justement
nana
sortait
du
lit
les
jambes
nues
elle
neut
pas
de
hâte
tendit
les
mains
pour
que
zoé
pût
enfiler
les
manches
du
peignoir
et
francis
très
à
laise
dun
air
digne
attendait
sans
se
retourner
puis
quand
elle
se
fut
assise
et
quil
lui
eut
donné
un
premier
coup
de
peigne
il
parla
madame
n
peutêtre
pas
vu
les
journaux
il
un
article
très
bon
dans
le
figaro
il
avait
acheté
le
journal
madame
lerat
mit
ses
lunettes
et
lut
larticle
à
voix
haute
debout
devant
la
fenêtre
elle
redressait
sa
taille
de
gendarme
son
nez
se
pinçait
lorsquelle
lançait
un
adjectif
galant
cétait
une
chronique
de
fauchery
écrite
au
sortir
du
théâtre
deux
colonnes
très
chaudes
dune
méchanceté
spirituelle
pour
lartiste
et
dune
brutale
admiration
pour
la
femme
excellent
répétait
francis
nana
se
moquait
pas
mal
quon
la
plaisantât
sur
sa
voix
il
était
gentil
ce
fauchery
elle
lui
revaudrait
sa
bonne
manière
madame
lerat
après
avoir
relu
larticle
déclara
brusquement
que
les
hommes
avaient
tous
le
diable
dans
les
mollets
et
elle
refusa
de
sexpliquer
davantage
satisfaite
de
cette
allusion
égrillarde
quelle
était
seule
à
comprendre
mais
francis
achevait
de
relever
et
de
nouer
les
cheveux
de
nana
il
salua
en
disant
jaurai
loeil
sur
les
journaux
du
soir
comme

nestce
pas
à
cinq
heures
et
demie
apportezmoi
un
pot
de
pommade
et
une
livre
de
pralines
de
chez
boissier
lui
cria
nana
à
travers
le
salon
au
moment
où
il
refermait
la
porte
alors
les
deux
femmes
restées
seules
se
souvinrent
quelles
ne
sétaient
pas
embrassées
et
elles
se
posèrent
de
gros
baisers
sur
les
joues
larticle
les
échauffait
nana
jusquelà
endormie
fut
reprise
de
la
fièvre
de
son
triomphe
ah
bien
cétait
rose
mignon
qui
devait
passer
une
jolie
matinée
sa
tante
nayant
pas
voulu
venir
au
théâtre
parce
que
disaitelle
les
émotions
lui
cassaient
lestomac
elle
se
mit
à
lui
raconter
la
soirée
en
se
grisant
de
son
propre
récit
comme
si
paris
entier
eût
croulé
sous
les
applaudissements
puis
sinterrompant
tout
dun
coup
elle
demanda
avec
un
rire
si
lon
aurait
dit
ça
quand
elle
traînait
son
derrière
de
gamine
rue
de
la
gouttedor
madame
lerat
branlait
la
tête
non
non
jamais
naurait
pu
prévoir
son
tour
elle
parla
prenant
un
air
grave
et
lappelant
sa
fille
estce
quelle
nétait
pas
sa
seconde
mère
puisque
la
vraie
avait
rejoint
le
papa
et
la
grandmaman
nana
très
attendrie
fut
sur
le
point
de
pleurer
mais
madame
lerat
répétait
que
le
passé
était
le
passé
oh
un
sale
passé
des
choses
à
ne
pas
remuer
tous
les
jours
longtemps
elle
avait
cessé
de
voir
sa
nièce
car
dans
la
famille
laccusait
de
se
perdre
avec
la
petite
comme
si
cétait
dieu
possible
elle
ne
lui
demandait
pas
de
confidences
elle
croyait
quelle
avait
toujours
vécu
proprement
présent
ça
lui
suffisait
de
la
retrouver
dans
une
belle
position
et
de
lui
voir
de
bons
sentiments
pour
son
fils
il
n
avait
encore
en
ce
monde
que
lhonnêteté
et
le
travail
de
qui
estil
ce
bébé
ditelle
en
sinterrompant
les
yeux
allumés
dune
curiosité
aiguë

hésita
une
seconde
dun
monsieur
réponditelle

la
tante

chiffre
la
tante

à
la
nièce
de

serrer
le
gaviot
puisquelle

tenait
elle
parlait
des
hommes
toutes

sembrassèrent
encore
mais
nana
au
milieu
de
sa
joie
comme
elle
remettait
la
conversation
sur
louiset
parut
sassombrir
à
un
brusque
souvenir
estce
embêtant
il
faut
que

sorte
à
trois
heures
murmuratelle
en
voilà
une
corvée

que

dans
la
salle
à

où
une
dame
âgée
se
trouvait
déjà
assise
devant
la
table
elle
navait
pas
retiré
son
chapeau
vêtue
dune
robe
sombre
de
couleur
indécise
entre
le
puce
et
le
caca
doie
nana
ne
parut
pas
étonnée
de
la
voir
là
elle
lui
demanda
simplement
pourquoi
elle
nétait

dans
la
chambre
jai
entendu
des

la
vieille

et
laccompagnait

présence
de
madame

dabord
linquiéter
puis
quand
elle
sut
que
cétait
une
tante
elle
la
regarda
dun
air
doux
avec
un
pâle
sourire
cependant
nana
qui
disait
avoir
lestomac
dans
les
talons
se
jetait
sur
des
radis
quelle
croquait
sans
pain
madame
lerat
devenue
cérémonieuse
ne
voulut
pas
de
radis
ça

la
pituite
puis
lorsque
zoé

apporté
des
côtelettes

chipota
la
viande

contenta
de
sucer

par
moments
elle
examinait
du
coin
de

de
sa
vieille
amie

le

vous

madame

extravagant
évasé
sur
le

empanaché
dune
haute
plume
madame
maloir
avait
la
manie
de
refaire
tous
ses
chapeaux
elle
seule
savait
ce
qui
lui
allait
et
en
un
tour
de
main
elle
faisait
une
casquette
de
la
plus
élégante
coiffure
nana
qui
justement
lui
avait
acheté
ce
chapeau
pour

très
bien

des
chouxfleurs
et
un

sur
sa
chaise
et
comme
zoé
était
restée
là
adossée
contre
le
buffet
les
mains
ballantes
en
vint
à
écouter
son
histoire
elle
se
disait
fille
dune
sagefemme
de
bercy
qui
avait
fait
de
mauvaises
affaires
dabord
elle
était
entrée
chez
un
dentiste
puis
chez
un
courtier
dassurances
mais
ça
ne
lui
allait
pas
et
elle
énumérait
ensuite
avec
une
pointe
dorgueil
les
dames
où
elle
avait
servi
comme
femme
de
chambre
zoé
parlait
de
ces
dames
en
personne
qui
avait
tenu
leur
fortune
dans
sa
main
bien
sûr
que
plus
dune
sans
elle
aurait
eu
de
drôles
dhistoires
ainsi
un
jour
que
madame
blanche
était
avec
monsieur
octave
voilà
le
vieux
qui
arrive
que
fait
zoé
elle
feint
de
tomber
en
traversant
le
salon
le
vieux
se
précipite
court
lui
chercher
un
verre
deau
à
la
cuisine
et
monsieur
octave
séchappe
ah
elle
est
bonne
par
exemple
dit
nana
qui
lécoutait
avec
un
intérêt
tendre
une
sorte
dadmiration
soumise
moi
jai
eu
bien
des
malheurs
commença
madame
lerat
et
se
rapprochant
de
madame
maloir
elle
lui
fit
des
confidences
toutes
deux
prenaient
des
canards
mais
madame
maloir
recevait
les
secrets
des
autres
sans
jamais
rien
lâcher
sur
elle
disait
quelle
vivait
dune
pension
mystérieuse
dans
une
chambre
où
personne
ne
pénétrait
tout
à
coup
nana
semporta
tante
ne
joue
donc
pas
avec
les
couteaux
tu
sais
que
ça
retourne
sans
prendre
garde
madame
lerat
venait
de
mettre
deux
couteaux
en
croix
sur
la
table
dailleurs
la
jeune
femme
se
défendait
dêtre
superstitieuse
ainsi
le
sel
renversé
ne
signifiait
rien
le
vendredi
non
plus
mais
les
couteaux
cétait
plus
fort
quelle
jamais
ça
navait
menti
certainement
il
lui
arriverait
une
chose
désagréable
elle
bâilla
puis
dun
air
de
profond
ennui
déjà
deux
heures
il
faut
que
je
sorte
quel
embêtement
les
deux
vieilles
se
regardèrent
toutes
trois
hochèrent
la
tête
sans
parler
bien
sûr
ce
nétait
pas
toujours
amusant
nana
sétait
renversée
de
nouveau
allumant
encore
une
cigarette
pendant
que
les
autres
pinçaient
les
lèvres
par
discrétion
pleines
de
philosophie
en
vous
attendant
nous
allons
faire
un
bézigue
dit
madame
maloir
au
bout
dun
silence
madame
joue
le
bézigue
certes
madame
lerat
le
jouait
et
à
la
perfection
il
était
inutile
de
déranger
zoé
qui
avait
disparu
un
coin
de
la
table
suffirait
et
lon
retroussa
la
nappe
pardessus
les
assiettes
sales
mais
comme
madame
maloir
allait
prendre
ellemême
les
cartes
dans
un
tiroir
du
buffet
nana
dit
quavant
de
se
mettre
au
jeu
elle
serait
bien
gentille
de
lui
faire
une
lettre
ça
lennuyait
décrire
puis
elle
nétait
pas
sûre
de
son
orthographe
tandis
que
sa
vieille
amie
tournait
des
lettres
pleines
de
coeur
elle
courut
chercher
du
beau
papier
dans
sa
chambre
un
encrier
une
bouteille
dencre
de
trois
sous
traînait
sur
un
meuble
avec
une
plume
empâtée
de
rouille
la
lettre
était
pour
daguenet
madame
maloir
dellemême
mit
de
sa
belle
anglaise
mon
petit
homme
chéri
et
elle
lavertissait
ensuite
de
ne
pas
venir
le
lendemain
parce
que
ça
ne
se
pouvait
pas
mais
de
loin
comme
de
près
à
tous
les
moments
elle
était
avec
lui
en
pensée
et
je
termine
par
mille
baisers
murmuratelle
madame
lerat
avait
approuvé
chaque
phrase
dun
mouvement
de
tête
ses
regards
flambaient
elle
adorait
se
trouver
dans
les
histoires
de
coeur
aussi
voulutelle
mettre
du
sien
prenant
un
air
tendre
roucoulant
mille
baisers
sur
tes
beaux
yeux
cest
ça
mille
baisers
sur
tes
beaux
yeux
répéta
nana
pendant
quune
expression
béate
passait
sur
les
visages
des
deux
vieilles
sonna
zoé
pour
quelle
descendît
la
lettre
à
un
commissionnaire
justement
elle
causait
avec
le
garçon
du
théâtre
qui
apportait
à
madame
un
bulletin
de
service
oublié
le
matin
nana
fit
entrer
cet
homme
quelle
chargea
de
porter
la
lettre
chez
daguenet
en
sen
retournant
puis
elle
lui
posa
des
questions
oh
bordenave
était
bien
content
il
avait
déjà
de
la
location
pour
huit
jours
madame
ne
simaginait
pas
le
nombre
de
personnes
qui
demandaient
son
adresse
depuis
le
matin
quand
le
garçon
fut
parti
nana
dit
quelle
resterait
au
plus
une
demiheure
dehors
si
des
visites
venaient
zoé
ferait
attendre
comme
elle
parlait
la
sonnerie
électrique
tinta
cétait
un
créancier
le
loueur
de
voitures
il
sétait
installé
sur
la
banquette
de
lantichambre
celuilà
pouvait
tourner
ses
pouces
jusquau
soir
rien
ne
pressait
allons
du
courage
dit
nana
engourdie
de
paresse
bâillant
et
sétirant
de
nouveau
je
devrais
être
làbas
pourtant
elle
ne
bougeait
point
elle
suivait
le
jeu
de
sa
tante
qui
venait
dannoncer
cent
das
le
menton
dans
la
main
elle
sabsorbait
mais
elle
eut
un
sursaut
en
entendant
sonner
trois
heures
nom
de
dieu
lâchatelle
brutalement
alors
madame
maloir
qui
comptait
les
brisques
lencouragea
de
sa
voix
molle
petite
il
vaudrait
mieux
vous
débarrasser
de
votre
course
tout
de
suite
fais
vite
dit
madame
lerat
en
battant
les
cartes
je
prendrai
le
train
de
quatre
heures
et
demie
si
tu
es
ici
avec
largent
avant
quatre
heures
oh
ça
ne
traînera
pas
murmuratelle
en
dix
minutes
zoé
laida
à
passer
une
robe
et
à
mettre
un
chapeau
ça
lui
était
égal
dêtre
mal
fichue
comme
elle
allait
descendre
il
eut
un
nouveau
tintement
de
la
sonnerie
cette
fois
cétait
le
charbonnier
eh
bien
il
tiendrait
compagnie
au
loueur
de
voitures
ça
les
distrairait
ces
gens
seulement
craignant
une
scène
elle
traversa
la
cuisine
et
fila
par
lescalier
de
service
elle
passait
souvent
elle
en
était
quitte
pour
relever
ses
jupes
quand
est
bonne
mère
ça
fait
tout
pardonner
dit
sentencieusement
madame
maloir
restée
seule
avec
madame
lerat
jai
quatrevingts
de
roi
répondit
celleci
que
le
jeu
passionnait
et
toutes
deux
senfoncèrent
dans
une
partie
interminable
la
table
navait
pas
été
desservie
une
buée
trouble
emplissait
la
pièce
lodeur
du
déjeuner
la
fumée
des
cigarettes
ces
dames
sétaient
remises
à
prendre
des
canards
il
avait
vingt
minutes
quelles
jouaient
en
sirotant
lorsque
à
un
troisième
appel
de
la
sonnerie
zoé
entra
brusquement
et
les
bouscula
comme
des
camarades
à
elle
dites
donc
sonne
encore
vous
ne
pouvez
pas
rester
là
sil
vient
beaucoup
de
monde
il
faut
tout
lappartement
allons
houp
houp
madame
maloir
voulait
finir
la
partie
mais
zoé
ayant
fait
mine
de
sauter
sur
les
cartes
elle
se
décida
à
enlever
le
jeu
sans
rien
déranger
pendant
que
madame
lerat
déménageait
la
bouteille
de
cognac
les
verres
et
le
sucre
et
toutes
deux
coururent
à
la
cuisine
où
elles
sinstallèrent
sur
un
bout
de
la
table
entre
les
torchons
qui
séchaient
et
la
bassine
encore
pleine
deau
de
vaisselle
nous
avons
dit
trois
cent
quarante
vous
je
joue
du
coeur
lorsque
zoé
revint
elle
les
trouva
de
nouveau
absorbées
au
bout
dun
silence
comme
madame
lerat
battait
les
cartes
madame
maloir
demanda
qui
estce
oh
personne
répondit
la
bonne
négligemment
un
petit
jeune
homme
je
voulais
le
renvoyer
mais
il
est
si
joli
sans
un
poil
de
barbe
avec
ses
yeux
bleus
et
sa
figure
de
fille
que
jai
fini
par
lui
dire
dattendre
il
tient
un
énorme
bouquet
dont
il
n
jamais
consenti
à
se
débarrasser
si
ce
nest
pas
à
lui
allonger
des
claques
un
morveux
qui
devrait
être
encore
au
collège
madame
lerat
alla
chercher
une
carafe
deau
pour
faire
un
grog
les
canards
lavaient
altérée
zoé
murmura
que
tout
de
même
elle
en
boirait
bien
un
aussi
elle
avait
disaitelle
la
bouche
amère
comme
du
fiel
alors
vous
lavez
mis
reprit
madame
maloir
tiens
dans
le
cabinet
du
fond
la
petite
pièce
qui
nest
pas
meublée
il
tout
juste
une
malle
à
madame
et
une
table
cest
là
que
je
loge
les
pignoufs
et
elle
sucrait
fortement
son
grog
lorsque
la
sonnerie
électrique
la
fit
sauter
nom
dun
chien
estce
quon
ne
la
laisserait
pas
boire
tranquillement
ça
promettait
si
le
carillon
commençait
déjà
pourtant
elle
courut
ouvrir
puis
à
son
retour
voyant
madame
maloir
qui
linterrogeait
du
regard
rien
un
bouquet
toutes
trois
se
rafraîchirent
en
se
saluant
dun
signe
de
tête
il
eut
coup
sur
coup
deux
autres
sonneries
pendant
que
zoé
desservait
enfin
la
table
rapportant
les
assiettes
sur
lévier
une
à
une
mais
tout
cela
nétait
pas
sérieux
elle
tenait
la
cuisine
au
courant
elle
répéta
deux
fois
sa
phrase
dédaigneuse
rien
un
bouquet
cependant
ces
dames
entre
deux
levées
de
cartes
eurent
un
rire
en
lui
entendant
raconter
la
tête
des
créanciers
dans
lantichambre
lorsque
les
fleurs
arrivaient
madame
trouverait
ses
bouquets
sur
sa
toilette
dommage
que
ce
fût
si
cher
et
quon
ne
pût
en
tirer
seulement
dix
sous
enfin
il
avait
bien
de
largent
perdu
moi
dit
madame
maloir
je
contenterais
par
jour
de
ce
que
les
hommes
dépensent
en
fleurs
pour
les
femmes
à
paris
je
crois
bien
vous
nêtes
pas
difficile
murmura
madame
lerat
aurait
seulement
largent
du
fil
chère
soixante
de
dames
il
était
quatre
heures
moins
dix
zoé
sétonnait
ne
comprenant
pas
que
madame
restât
si
longtemps
dehors
dordinaire
lorsque
madame
se
trouvait
forcée
de
sortir
laprèsmidi
elle
emballait
ça
et
rondement
mais
madame
maloir
déclara
quon
ne
faisait
pas
toujours
les
choses
comme
voulait
certainement
il
avait
des
anicroches
dans
la
vie
disait
madame
lerat
le
mieux
était
dattendre
si
sa
nièce
sattardait
ça
devait
être
que
ses
occupations
la
retenaient
nestce
pas
dailleurs
ne
peinait
guère
il
faisait
bon
dans
la
cuisine
et
comme
elle
navait
plus
de
coeur
madame
lerat
jeta
du
carreau
la
sonnerie
recommençait
quand
zoé
reparut
elle
était
tout
allumée
mes
enfants
le
gros
steiner
ditelle
dès
la
porte
en
baissant
la
voix
celuilà
je
lai
mis
dans
le
petit
salon
alors
madame
maloir
parla
du
banquier
à
madame
lerat
qui
ne
connaissait
pas
ces
messieurs
estce
quil
était
en
train
de
lâcher
rose
mignon
zoé
hochait
la
tête
elle
savait
des
choses
mais
de
nouveau
il
lui
fallut
aller
ouvrir
bon
une
tuile
murmuratelle
en
revenant
cest
le
moricaud
jai
eu
beau
lui
répéter
que
madame
était
sortie
il
sest
installé
dans
la
chambre
à
coucher
nous
ne
lattendions
que
ce
soir
quatre
heures
un
quart
nana
nétait

là
que
pouvaitelle

ça
navait
pas
de
bon
sens
apporta
deux
autres
bouquets
zoé
ennuyée
regarda
sil
restait
du
café
oui
ces
dames
finiraient
volontiers
le
café
ça
les
réveillerait
elles
sendormaient
tassées
sur
leurs
chaises
à
prendre
continuellement
des
cartes
au
talon
du
même
geste
la
demie
sonna
décidément
avait
fait
quelque
chose
à
madame
elles
chuchotaient
entre
elles
tout
à
coup
soubliant
madame
maloir
annonça
dune
voix
éclatante
jai
le

majeure
datout
taisezvous

dit
zoé
avec
colère
que

penser
tous
ces
messieurs
et
dans
le
silence
qui
régna
dans
le
murmure
étouffé
des
deux
vieilles
femmes
se
querellant
un
bruit
de
pas
rapides
monta
de
lescalier
de
service
cétait
nana
enfin
avant
quelle
eût
ouvert
la
porte
entendit
son
essoufflement
elle
entra
très
rouge
le
geste
brusque
sa
jupe
dont
les
tirettes
avaient
dû
casser
essuyait
les
marches
et
les
volants
venaient
de
tremper
dans
une
mare
quelque
pourriture
coulée
du
premier
étage
où
la
bonne
était
un
vrai
souillon
te
voilà
ce
nest

dit
madame
lerat
les
lèvres
pincées
encore
vexée
des
cinq
cents
de
madame
maloir
tu
peux
te
flatter
de
faire
poser
les
gens
madame
nest
pas
raisonnable

ajouta
zoé
nana
déjà
mécontente
fut
exaspérée
par
ces
reproches

question
répondit
nana
elle
sétait
assise
sur
une
chaise
contre
le
fourneau
les
jambes
coupées
par
sa
course
et
sans
reprendre
haleine
elle
tira
de
son
corsage
une
enveloppe
dans
laquelle
se
trouvaient
quatre
billets
de
cent
francs
voyait
les
billets
par
une
large
déchirure
quelle
avait
faite
dun
doigt
brutal
pour
sassurer
du
contenu
les
trois
femmes
autour
delle
regardaient
fixement
lenveloppe
un
gros
papier
froissé
et
sali
entre
ses
petites
mains
gantées
il
était
trop
tard
madame

nirait
que
le

explications
madame

la
femme
de

mais
elle
semporta
de
nouveau
le
monde
pouvait
attendre
tout
à
lheure
quand
elle
ne
serait
plus
en
affaire
et
comme
sa
tante
avançait
la
main
vers

de

monnaie

dix
francs
dans
la
maison
ne
sadressa
même
pas
à
madame
maloir
qui
écoutait
dun
air
désintéressé
nayant
jamais
sur
elle
que
les
six
sous
dun
omnibus
enfin
zoé
sortit
en
disant
quelle

sa
malle
et
elle
rapporta
cent
francs
en
pièces
de
cent
sous

compta
sur
un
bout
de

murmura
zoé
sans
bouger
dun
air
grave
fâchée
de
voir
sa
maîtresse
sur
le
point
de
faire
encore
une
bêtise
puis
elle
parla
du
valaque
qui
devait
commencer
à
trouver
le
temps
long
dans
la
chambre
alors
nana
furieuse
sentêta
davantage
personne

le
comble

un
raseur
elle
défendit
à
zoé
daller
ouvrir
celleci
sans
lécouter

cuisine
quand

dun
air

que

ces
messieurs

dans
le
salon
nana

rageusement
mais
les
noms
du
marquis
de
chouard
et
du
comte

de

sur
les
cartes

calmèrent
elle

un
instant
silencieuse
questce

enfin

le
vieux
répondit
zoé
en
pinçant
la
bouche
dune
façon
discrète
et
comme
sa
maîtresse
continuait
à
linterroger
des
yeux
elle
ajouta
simplement
je
lai
vu
quelque
part
cette
parole
sembla
décider
la
jeune
femme
elle
quitta
la
cuisine
à
regret
ce
refuge
tiède
où
lon
pouvait
causer
et
sabandonner
dans
lodeur
du
café
chauffant
sur
un
reste
de
braise
derrière
son
dos
elle
laissait
madame
maloir
qui
maintenant
faisait
des
réussites
elle
navait
toujours
pas
ôté
son
chapeau
seulement
pour
se
mettre
à
laise
elle
venait
de
dénouer
les
brides
et
de
les
rejeter
sur
ses
épaules
dans
le
cabinet
de
toilette
où
zoé
laida
vivement
à
passer
un
peignoir
nana
se
vengea
des
ennuis
quon
lui
causait
en
mâchant
de
sourds
jurons
contre
les
hommes
ces
gros
mots
chagrinaient
la
femme
de
chambre
car
elle
voyait
avec
peine
que
madame
ne
se
décrassait
pas
vite
de
ses
commencements
elle
osa
même
supplier
madame
de
se
calmer
ah
ouiche
répondit
nana
crûment
ce
sont
des
salauds
ils
aiment
ça
pourtant
elle
prit
son
air
de
princesse
comme
elle
disait
zoé
lavait
retenue
au
moment
où
elle
se
dirigeait
vers
le
salon
et
dellemême
elle
introduisit
dans
le
cabinet
de
toilette
le
marquis
de
chouard
et
le
comte
muffat
cétait
beaucoup
mieux
messieurs
dit
la
jeune
femme
avec
une
politesse
étudiée
je
regrette
de
vous
avoir
fait
attendre
les
deux
hommes
saluèrent
et
sassirent
un
store
de
tulle
brodé

un
demijour
dans
le
cabinet
cétait
la
pièce
la
plus
élégante
de
lappartement
tendue
détoffe
claire
avec
une
grande
toilette
de
marbre
une
psyché
marquetée
une
chaise
longue
et
des
fauteuils
de
satin
bleu
sur
la
toilette
les
bouquets
des
roses
des
lilas
des
jacinthes
mettaient
comme
un
écroulement
de
fleurs
dun
parfum
pénétrant
et
fort
tandis
que
dans
lair
moite
dans
la
fadeur
exhalée
des
cuvettes
traînait
par
instant
une
odeur
plus
aiguë
quelques
brins
de
patchouli
sec
brisés
menu
au
fond
dune
coupe
et
se
pelotonnant
ramenant
son
peignoir
mal
attaché
nana
semblait
avoir
été
surprise
à
sa
toilette
la
peau
humide
encore
souriante
effarouchée
au
milieu
de
ses
dentelles
madame
dit
gravement
le
comte
muffat
vous
nous
excuserez
davoir
insisté
nous
venons
pour
une
quête
monsieur
et
moi
sommes
membres
du
bureau
de
bienfaisance
de
larrondissement
le
marquis
de
chouard
se
hâta
dajouter
dun
air
galant
quand
nous
avons
appris
quune
grande
artiste
habitait
cette
maison
nous
nous
sommes
promis
de
lui
recommander
nos
pauvres
dune
façon
particulière
le
talent
ne
va
pas
sans
le
coeur
nana
jouait
la
modestie
elle
répondait
par
de
petits
mouvements
de
tête
tout
en
faisant
de
rapides
réflexions
ça
devait
être
le
vieux
qui
avait
amené
lautre
ses
yeux
étaient
trop
polissons
pourtant
il
fallait
aussi
se
méfier
de
lautre
dont
les
tempes
se
gonflaient
drôlement
il
aurait
bien
pu
venir
tout
seul
cétait
ça
le
concierge
lavait
nommée
et
ils
se
poussaient
chacun
pour
son
compte
certainement
messieurs
vous
avez
eu
raison
de
monter
ditelle
pleine
de
bonne
grâce
mais
la
sonnerie
électrique
la
fit
tressaillir
encore
une
visite
et
cette
zoé
qui
ouvrait
toujours
elle
continua
est
trop
heureux
de
pouvoir
donner
au
fond
elle
était
flattée
ah
madame
reprit
le
marquis
si
vous
saviez
quelle
misère
notre
arrondissement
compte
plus
de
trois
mille
pauvres
et
encore
estil
un
des
plus
riches
vous
ne
vous
imaginez
pas
une
pareille
détresse
des
enfants
sans
pain
des
femmes
malades
privées
de
tout
secours
mourant
de
froid
les
pauvres
gens
cria
nana
très
attendrie
son
apitoiement
fut
tel
que
des
larmes
noyèrent
ses
beaux
yeux
dun
mouvement
elle
sétait
penchée
ne
sétudiant
plus
et
son
peignoir
ouvert
laissa
voir
son
cou
tandis
que
ses
genoux
tendus
dessinaient
sous
la
mince
étoffe
la
rondeur
de
la
cuisse
un
peu
de
sang
parut
aux
joues
terreuses
du
marquis
le
comte
muffat
qui
allait
parler
baissa
les
yeux
il
faisait
trop
chaud
dans
ce
cabinet
une
chaleur
lourde
et
enfermée
de
serre
les
roses
se
fanaient
une
griserie
montait
du
patchouli
de
la
coupe
voudrait
être
très
riche
dans
ces
occasions
ajoutait
nana
enfin
chacun
fait
ce
quil
peut
croyez
bien
messieurs
que
si
javais
su
elle
était
sur
le
point
de
lâcher
une
bêtise
dans
son
attendrissement
aussi
nachevatelle
pas
la
phrase
un
instant
elle
resta
gênée
ne
se
rappelant
plus
où
elle
venait
de
mettre
ses
cinquante
francs
en
ôtant
sa
robe
mais
elle
se
souvint
ils
devaient
être
au
coin
de
la
toilette
sous
un
pot
de
pommade
renversé
comme
elle
se
levait
la
sonnerie
retentit
longuement
bon
encore
un
ça
ne
finirait
pas
le
comte
et
le
marquis
sétaient
également
mis
debout
et
les
oreilles
de
ce
dernier
avaient
remué
se
pointant
vers
la
porte
sans
doute
il
connaissait
ces
coups
de
sonnette
muffat
le
regarda
puis
ils
détournèrent
les
yeux
ils
se
gênaient
ils
redevinrent
froids
lun
carré
et
solide
avec
sa
chevelure
fortement
plantée
lautre
redressant
ses
épaules
maigres
sur
lesquelles
tombait
sa
couronne
de
rares
cheveux
blancs
foi
dit
nana
qui
apportait
les
dix
grosses
pièces
dargent
en
prenant
le
parti
de
rire
je
vais
vous
charger
messieurs
cest
pour
les
pauvres
et
le
petit
trou
adorable
de
son
menton
se
creusait
elle
avait
son
air
bon
enfant
sans
pose
tenant
la
pile
des
écus
sur
sa
main
ouverte
loffrant
aux
deux
hommes
comme
pour
leur
dire
voyons
qui
en
veut
le
comte
fut
le
plus
leste
il
prit
les
cinquante
francs
mais
une
pièce
resta
et
il
dut
pour
lavoir
la
ramasser
sur
la
peau
même
de
la
jeune
femme
une
peau
tiède
et
souple
qui
lui
laissa
un
frisson
elle
égayée
riait
toujours
voilà
messieurs
repritelle
une
autre
fois
jespère
donner
davantage
ils
navaient
plus
de
prétexte
ils
saluèrent
en
se
dirigeant
vers
la
porte
mais
au
moment
où
ils
allaient
sortir
de
nouveau
la
sonnerie
éclata
le
marquis
ne
put
cacher
un
pâle
sourire
tandis
quune
ombre
rendait
le
comte
plus
grave
nana
les
retint
quelques
secondes
pour
permettre
à
zoé
de
trouver
encore
un
coin
elle
naimait
pas
quon
se
rencontrât
chez
elle
seulement
cette
fois
ça
devait
être
bondé
aussi
futelle
soulagée
lorsquelle
vit
le
salon
vide
zoé
les
avait
donc
fourrés
dans
les
armoires
au
revoir
messieurs
ditelle
en
sarrêtant
sur
le
seuil
du
salon
elle
les
enveloppait
de
son
rire
et
de
son
regard
clair
le
comte
muffat
sinclina
troublé
malgré
son
grand
usage
du
monde
ayant
besoin
dair
emportant
un
vertige
de
ce
cabinet
de
toilette
une
odeur
de
fleur
et
de
femme
qui
létouffait
et
derrière
lui
le
marquis
de
chouard
certain
de
nêtre
pas
vu
osa
adresser
à
nana
un
clignement
doeil
la
face
tout
dun
coup
décomposée
la
langue
au
bord
des
lèvres
lorsque
la
jeune
femme
rentra
dans
le
cabinet
où
zoé
lattendait
avec
des
lettres
et
des
cartes
de
visite
elle
cria
en
riant
plus
fort
en
voilà
des
panés
qui
mont
fait
mes
cinquante
francs
elle
nétait
point
fâchée
cela
lui
semblait
drôle
que
des
hommes
lui
eussent
emporté
de
largent
tout
de
même
cétaient
des
cochons
elle
navait
plus
le
sou
mais
la
vue
des
cartes
et
des
lettres
lui
rendit
sa
mauvaise
humeur
les
lettres
passe
encore
elles
venaient
de
messieurs
qui
après
lavoir
applaudie
la
veille
lui
adressaient
des
déclarations
quant
aux
visiteurs
ils
pouvaient
aller
se
promener
zoé
en
avait
mis
partout
et
elle
faisait
remarquer
que
lappartement
était
très
commode
chaque
pièce
ouvrant
sur
le
corridor
ce
nétait
pas
comme
chez
madame
blanche
où
il
fallait
passer
par
le
salon
aussi
madame
blanche
avaitelle
eu
bien
des
ennuis
vous
allez
tous
les
renvoyer
reprit
nana
qui
suivait
son
idée
commencez
par
le
moricaud
celuilà
madame
il
beau
temps
que
je
lai
congédié
dit
zoé
avec
un
sourire
il
voulait
simplement
dire
à
madame
quil
ne
pouvait
venir
ce
soir
ce
fut
une
grosse
joie
nana
battit
des
mains
il
ne
venait
pas
quelle
chance
elle
serait
donc
libre
et
elle
poussait
des
soupirs
de
soulagement
comme
si
lavait
graciée
du
plus
abominable
des
supplices
sa
première
pensée
fut
pour
daguenet
ce
pauvre
chat
auquel
justement
elle
avait
écrit
dattendre
le
jeudi
vite
madame
maloir
allait
faire
une
seconde
lettre
mais
zoé
dit
que
madame
maloir
avait
filé
sans
quon
sen
aperçût
comme
à
son
habitude
alors
nana
après
avoir
parlé
denvoyer
quelquun
resta
hésitante
elle
était
bien
lasse
toute
une
nuit
à
dormir
ce
serait
si
bon
lidée
de
ce
régal
finit
par
lemporter
pour
une
fois
elle
pouvait
se
payer
ça
je
coucherai
en
rentrant
du
théâtre
murmuraitelle
dun
air
gourmand
et
vous
ne
réveillerez
pas
avant
midi
puis
haussant
la
voix
houp
maintenant
poussezmoi
les
autres
dans
lescalier
zoé
ne
bougeait
pas
elle
ne
se
serait
pas
permis
de
donner
ouvertement
des
conseils
à
madame
seulement
elle
sarrangeait
pour
faire
profiter
madame
de
son
expérience
quand
madame
paraissait
semballer
avec
sa
mauvaise
tête
monsieur
steiner
aussi
demandatelle
dune
voix
brève
certainement
répondit
nana
lui
avant
les
autres
la
bonne
attendit
encore
pour
donner
à
madame
le
temps
de
la
réflexion
madame
ne
serait
donc
pas
fière
denlever
à
sa
rivale
rose
mignon
un
monsieur
si
riche
connu
dans
tous
les
théâtres
dépêchezvous
donc
chère
reprit
nana
qui
comprenait
parfaitement
et
diteslui
quil
membête
mais
brusquement
elle
eut
un
retour
le
lendemain
elle
pouvait
en
avoir
envie
et
elle
cria
avec
un
geste
de
gamin
riant
clignant
les
yeux
après
tout
si
je
veux
lavoir
le
plus
court
est
encore
de
le
flanquer
à
la
porte
zoé
parut
très
frappée
elle
regarda
madame
prise
dune
subite
admiration
puis
alla
flanquer
steiner
à
la
porte
sans
balancer
cependant
nana
patienta
quelques
minutes
pour
lui
laisser
le
temps
de
balayer
le
plancher
comme
elle
disait
navait
pas
idée
dun
pareil
assaut
elle
allongea
la
tête
dans
le
salon
il
était
vide
la
salle
à
manger
vide
également
mais
comme
elle
continuait
sa
visite
tranquillisée
certaine
quil
n
avait
plus
personne
elle
tomba
tout
dun
coup
sur
un
petit
jeune
homme
en
poussant
la
porte
dun
cabinet
il
était
assis
en
haut
dune
malle
bien
tranquille
lair
très
sage
avec
un
énorme
bouquet
sur
les
genoux
ah
mon
dieu
criatelle
il
en
encore
un
làdedans
le
petit
jeune
homme
en
lapercevant
avait
sauté
à
terre
rouge
comme
un
coquelicot
et
il
ne
savait
que
faire
de
son
bouquet
quil
passait
dune
main
dans
lautre
étranglé
par
lémotion
sa
jeunesse
son
embarras
la
drôle
de
mine
quil
avait
avec
ses
fleurs
attendrirent
nana
qui
éclata
dun
beau
rire
alors
les
enfants
aussi
maintenant
les
hommes
lui
arrivaient
au
maillot
elle
sabandonna
familière
maternelle
se
tapant
sur
les
cuisses
et
demandant
par
rigolade
tu
veux
donc
quon
te
mouche
bébé
oui
répondit
le
petit
dune
voix
basse
et
suppliante
cette
réponse
légaya
davantage
il
avait
dixsept
ans
il
sappelait
georges
hugon
la
veille
il
était
aux
variétés
et
il
venait
la
voir
cest
pour
moi
ces
fleurs
oui
donneles
donc
nigaud
mais
comme
elle
prenait
le
bouquet
il
lui
sauta
sur
les
mains
avec
la
gloutonnerie
de
son
bel
âge
elle
dut
le
battre
pour
quil
lâchât
prise
en
voilà
un
morveux
qui
allait
raide
tout
en
le
grondant
elle
était
devenue
rose
elle
souriait
et
elle
le
renvoya
en
lui
permettant
de
revenir
il
chancelait
il
ne
trouvait
plus
les
portes
nana
retourna
dans
son
cabinet
de
toilette
où
francis
se
présenta
presque
aussitôt
pour
la
coiffer
définitivement
elle
ne
shabillait
que
le
soir
assise
devant
la
glace
baissant
la
tête
sous
les
mains
agiles
du
coiffeur
elle
restait
muette
et
rêveuse
lorsque
zoé
entra
en
disant
madame
il
en
un
qui
ne
veut
pas
partir
eh
bien
il
faut
le
laisser
réponditelle
tranquillement
avec
ça
il
en
vient
toujours
bah
disleur
dattendre
quand
ils
auront
trop
faim
ils
sen
iront
son
esprit
avait
tourné
cela
lenchantait
de
faire
poser
les
hommes
une
idée
acheva
de
lamuser
elle
séchappa
des
mains
de
francis
courut
mettre
ellemême
les
verrous
maintenant
ils
pouvaient
sentasser
à
côté
ils
ne
perceraient
pas
le
mur
peutêtre
zoé
entrerait
par
la
petite
porte
qui
menait
à
la
cuisine
cependant
la
sonnerie
électrique
marchait
de
plus
belle
toutes
les
cinq
minutes
le
tintement
revenait
vif
et
clair
avec
sa
régularité
de
machine
bien
réglée
et
nana
les
comptait
pour
se
distraire
mais
elle
eut
un
brusque
souvenir
mes
pralines
dites
donc
francis
lui
aussi
oubliait
les
pralines
il
tira
un
sac
dune
poche
de
sa
redingote
du
geste
discret
dun
homme
du
monde
offrant
un
cadeau
à
une
amie
pourtant
à
chaque
règlement
il
portait
les
pralines
sur
sa
note
nana
posa
le
sac
entre
ses
genoux
et
se
mit
à
croquer
en
tournant
la
tête
sous
les
légères
poussées
du
coiffeur
fichtre
murmuratelle
au
bout
dun
silence
voilà
une
bande
trois
fois
coup
sur
coup
la
sonnerie
avait
tinté
les
appels
du
timbre
se
précipitaient
il
en
avait
de
modestes
qui
balbutiaient
avec
le
tremblement
dun
premier
aveu
de
hardis
vibrant
sous
quelque
doigt
brutal
de
pressés
traversant
lair
dun
frisson
rapide
un
véritable
carillon
comme
disait
zoé
un
carillon
à
révolutionner
le
quartier
toute
une
cohue
dhommes
tapant
à
la
file
sur
le
bouton
divoire
ce
farceur
de
bordenave
avait
vraiment
donné
ladresse
à
trop
de
monde
toute
la
salle
de
la
veille
allait
passer
propos
francis
dit
nana

louis

se
recula
examina
la
coiffure
puis
tranquillement
cinq
louis
cest
selon
ah
vous
savez
repritelle
sil
vous
faut
des
garanties
et
sans
achever
la
phrase
dun
geste
large
elle
indiquait
les
pièces
voisines
francis
prêta
les
cinq
louis
zoé
dans
les
moments
de
répit
entrait
pour
préparer
la
toilette
de
madame
bientôt
elle
dut
lhabiller
tandis
que
le
coiffeur
attendait
voulant
donner
un
dernier
coup
à
la
coiffure
mais
la
sonnerie
continuellement
dérangeait
la
femme
de
chambre
qui
laissait
madame
à
moitié
lacée
chaussée
dun
pied
seulement
elle
perdait
la
tête
malgré
son
expérience
après
avoir
mis
des
hommes
un
peu
partout
en
utilisant
les
moindres
coins
elle
venait
dêtre
obligée
den
caser
jusqu
à
trois
et
quatre
ensemble
ce
qui
était
contraire
à
tous
ses
principes
tant
pis
sils
se
mangeaient
ça
ferait
de
la
place
et
nana
bien
verrouillée
à
labri
se
moquait
deux
en
disant
quelle
les
entendait
souffler
ils
devaient
avoir
une
bonne
tête
tous
la
langue
pendante
comme
des
toutous
assis
en
rond
sur
leur
derrière
cétait
son
succès
de
la
veille
qui
continuait
cette
meute
dhommes

suivie
à
la
trace
pourvu
quils
ne
cassent
rien

elle
commençait
à
sinquiéter
sous
les
haleines
chaudes
qui
passaient
par
les
fentes
mais
zoé
introduisit
labordette
et
la
jeune
femme
eut
un
cri
de
soulagement
il
voulait
lui
parler
dun
compte
quil

réglé
pour

à
la
justice
de

de
cent
ans
sur

haute
et
noire
dune
mélancolie
de
couvent
avec
dimmenses
persiennes

restaient
presque
toujours
fermées

dans
un

de

longs
et

ce

soirée
de

malgré

brûlaient
dans
la

jamais
le
soleil
ne
descendait
là
le
jour
une
clarté
verdâtre
éclairait
à

la
pièce
mais
le
soir
quand
les
lampes
et
le
lustre
étaient
allumés
elle
nétait
plus
que
grave
avec
ses

dans

des

une
odeur
de
dévotion

en

du

où
la

du

la

dun
maître
de

en
voyant
la
comtesse
prise
dun
léger
frisson
qui
la
pâlissait
mais
non
pas
du
tout
répondit
celleci
souriante
jai
eu
un
peu
froid
ce
salon
est
si
long
à
chauffer
et
elle
promenait
son
regard
noir
le
long
des
murs
jusquaux
hauteurs
du
plafond
estelle
sa
fille
une
jeune
personne
de
seize
ans
dans
lâge
ingrat
mince
et
insignifiante
quitta
le
tabouret
où
elle
était
assise
et
vint
silencieusement
relever
une
des
bûches
qui
avait
roulé
mais
madame

une
amie
de

de

plus
jeune

de
cinq
ans
sécriait
ah
bien
cest

avoir
un

comme
le
tien
au
moins
tu
peux
recevoir
ne
fait
plus
que
des
boîtes
aujourdhui
si
jétais
à
ta
place
elle
parlait
étourdiment
avec
des
gestes
vifs
expliquant
quelle
changerait
les
tentures
les
sièges
tout
puis
elle
donnerait
des
bals
à
faire
courir
paris
derrière
elle
son
mari
un
magistrat
écoutait
dun
air
grave
racontait
quelle
le
trompait
sans
se
cacher
mais
lui
pardonnait
la
recevait
quand
même
parce
que
disaiton
elle
était
folle
cette
léonide
se
contenta
de
murmurer
la
comtesse
sabine
avec
son
pâle
sourire
un
geste
paresseux
compléta
sa
pensée
certes
ce
ne
serait
pas
après
avoir
vécu
dixsept
ans
quelle
changerait
son
salon
maintenant
il
resterait
tel
que
sa
bellemère
avait
voulu
le
conserver
de
son
vivant
puis
revenant
à
la
conversation
assuré
que
nous
aurons
également
le
roi
de
prusse
et
lempereur
de
russie
oui
annonce
de
très
belles
fêtes
dit
madame
du
joncquoy
le
banquier
steiner
introduit
depuis
peu
dans
la
maison
par
léonide
de
chezelles
qui
connaissait
tout
paris
causait
sur
un
canapé
entre
deux
fenêtres
il
interrogeait
un
député
dont
il
tâchait
de
tirer
adroitement
des
nouvelles
au
sujet
dun
mouvement
de
bourse
quil
flairait
pendant
que
le
comte
muffat
debout
devant
eux
les
écoutait
en
silence
la
mine
plus
grise
encore
que
de
coutume
quatre
ou
cinq
jeunes
gens
faisaient
un
autre
groupe
près
de
la
porte
où
ils
entouraient
le
comte
xavier
de
vandeuvres
qui
à
demivoix
leur
racontait
une
histoire
très
leste
sans
doute
car
ils
étouffaient
des
rires
au
milieu
de
la
pièce
tout
seul
assis
pesamment
dans
un
fauteuil
un
gros
homme
chef
de
bureau
au
ministère
de
lintérieur
dormait
les
yeux
ouverts
mais
un
des
jeunes
gens
ayant
paru
douter
de
lhistoire
de
vandeuvres
celuici
haussa
la
voix
vous
êtes
trop
sceptique
foucarmont
vous
gâterez
vos
plaisirs
et
il
revint
en
riant
près
des
dames
le
dernier
dune
grande
race
féminin
et
spirituel
il
mangeait
alors
une
fortune
avec
une
rage
dappétits
que
rien
napaisait
son
écurie
de
courses
une
des
plus
célèbres
de
paris
lui
coûtait
un
argent
fou
ses
pertes
au
cercle
impérial
se
chiffraient
chaque
mois
par
un
nombre
de
louis
inquiétant
ses
maîtresses
lui
dévoraient
bon
mal
une
ferme
et
quelques
arpents
de
terre
ou
de
forêts
tout
un
lambeau
de
ses
vastes
domaines
de
picardie
je
vous
conseille
de
traiter
les
autres
de
sceptiques
vous
qui
ne
croyez
à
rien
dit
léonide
en
lui
ménageant
une
petite
place
à
côté
delle
cest
vous
qui
gâtez
vos
plaisirs
justement
réponditil
je
veux
faire
profiter
les
autres
de
mon
expérience
mais
lui
imposa
silence
il
scandalisait
venot
alors
les
dames
sétant
écartées
aperçut
au
fond
dune
chaise
longue
un
petit
homme
de
soixante
ans
avec
des
dents
mauvaises
et
un
sourire
fin
il
était
là
installé
comme
chez
lui
écoutant
tout
le
monde
ne
lâchant
pas
une
parole
dun
geste
il
dit
quil
nétait
pas
scandalisé
vandeuvres
avait
repris
son
grand
air
et
il
ajouta
gravement
monsieur
venot
sait
bien
que
je
crois
ce
quil
faut
croire
cétait
un
acte
de
foi
religieuse
léonide
ellemême
parut
satisfaite
dans
le
fond
de
la
pièce
les
jeunes
gens
ne
riaient
plus
le
salon
était
colletmonté
ils
ne
amusaient
guère
un
souffle
froid
avait
passé
entendait
au
milieu
du
silence
la
voix
nasillarde
de
steiner
que
la
discrétion
du
député
finissait
par
mettre
hors
de
lui
un
instant
la
comtesse
sabine
regarda
le
feu
puis
elle
renoua
la
conversation
jai
vu
le
roi
de
prusse
lannée
dernière
à
bade
il
est
encore
plein
de
vigueur
pour
son
âge
le
comte
de
bismarck
laccompagnera
dit
madame
du
joncquoy
connaissezvous
le
comte
jai
déjeuné
avec
lui
chez
mon
frère
oh
il
longtemps
lorsquil
représentait
la
prusse
à
paris
voilà
un
homme
dont
je
ne
comprends
guère
les
derniers
succès
pourquoi
donc
demanda
madame
chantereau
mon
dieu
comment
vous
dire
il
ne
plaît
pas
il
lair
brutal
et
mal
élevé
puis
moi
je
le
trouve
stupide
tout
le
monde
alors
parla
du
comte
de
bismarck
les
opinions
furent
très
partagées
vandeuvres
le
connaissait
et
assurait
quil
était
un
beau
buveur
et
un
beau
joueur
mais
au
fort
de
la
discussion
la
porte
souvrit
hector
de
la
faloise
parut
fauchery
qui
le
suivait
sapprocha
de
la
comtesse
et
sinclinant
madame
je
suis
souvenu
de
votre
gracieuse
invitation
elle
eut
un
sourire
un
mot
aimable
le
journaliste
après
avoir
salué
le
comte
resta
un
moment
dépaysé
au
milieu
du
salon
où
il
ne
reconnaissait
que
steiner
vandeuvres
sétant
tourné
vint
lui
donner
une
poignée
de
main
et
tout
de
suite
heureux
de
la
rencontre
pris
dun
besoin
dexpansion
fauchery
lattira
disant
à
voix
basse
cest
pour
demain
vous
en
êtes
parbleu
minuit
chez
elle
je
sais
je
sais
j
vais
avec
blanche
il
voulait
séchapper
pour
revenir
près
des
dames
donner
un
nouvel
argument
en
faveur
de
de
bismarck
mais
fauchery
le
retint
jamais
vous
ne
devineriez
de
quelle
invitation
elle
chargé
et
dun
léger
signe
de
tête
il
désigna
le
comte
muffat
qui
en
ce
moment
discutait
un
point
du
budget
avec
le
député
et
steiner
pas
possible
dit
vandeuvres
stupéfait
et
mis
en
gaieté
parole
jai
dû
jurer
de
le
lui
amener
je
viens
un
peu
pour
ça
tous
deux
eurent
un
rire
silencieux
et
vandeuvres
se
hâtant
rentrant
dans
le
cercle
des
dames
sécria
je
vous
affirme
au
contraire
que
monsieur
de
bismarck
est
très
spirituel
tenez
il
dit
un
soir
devant
moi
un
mot
charmant
cependant
la
faloise
ayant
entendu
les
quelques
paroles
rapides
échangées
à
demivoix
regardait
fauchery
espérant
une
explication
qui
ne
vint
pas
de
qui
parlaiton
que
faisaiton
le
lendemain
à
minuit
il
ne
lâcha
plus
son
cousin
celuici
était
allé
sasseoir
la
comtesse
sabine
surtout
lintéressait
avait
souvent
prononcé
son
nom
devant
lui
il
savait
que
mariée
à
dixsept
ans
elle
devait
en
avoir
trentequatre
et
quelle
menait
depuis
son
mariage
une
existence
cloîtrée
entre
son
mari
et
sa
bellemère
dans
le
monde
les
uns
la
disaient
dune
froideur
de
dévote
les
autres
la
plaignaient
en
rappelant
ses
beaux
rires
ses
grands
yeux
de
flamme
avant
quon
lenfermât
au
fond
de
ce
vieil
hôtel
fauchery
lexaminait
et
hésitait
un
de
ses
amis
mort
récemment
capitaine
au
mexique
lui
avait
la
veille
même
de
son
départ
au
sortir
de
table
fait
une
de
ces
confidences
brutales
que
les
hommes
les
plus
discrets
laissent
échapper
à
de
certains
moments
mais
ses
souvenirs
restaient
vagues
ce
soirlà
avait
bien
dîné
et
il
doutait
en
voyant
la
comtesse
au
milieu
de
ce
salon
antique
vêtue
de
noir
avec
son
tranquille
sourire
une
lampe
placée
derrière
elle
détachait
son
fin
profil
de
brune
potelée
où
la
bouche
seule
un
peu
épaisse
mettait
une
sorte
de
sensualité
impérieuse
quontils
donc
avec
leur
bismarck
murmura
la
faloise
qui
posait
pour
sennuyer
dans
le
monde
crève
ici
une
drôle
didée
que
tu
eue
de
vouloir
venir
fauchery
linterrogea
brusquement
dis
donc
la
comtesse
ne
couche
avec
personne
ah
non
ah
non
mon
cher
balbutiatil
visiblement
démonté
oubliant
sa
pose
où
croistu
donc
être
puis
il
eut
conscience
que
son
indignation
manquait
de
chic
il
ajouta
en
sabandonnant
au
fond
du
canapé
dame
je
dis
non
mais
je
nen
sais
pas
davantage
il
un
petit
làbas
ce
foucarmont
quon
trouve
dans
tous
les
coins
en
vu
de
plus
raide
que
ça
bien
sûr
moi
je
men
fiche
enfin
ce
quil
de
certain
cest
que
si
la
comtesse
samuse
à
cascader
elle
est
encore
maligne
car
ça
ne
circule
pas
personne
nen
cause
alors
sans
que
fauchery
prît
la
peine
de
le
questionner
il
lui
dit
ce
quil
savait
sur
les
muffat
au
milieu
de
la
conversation
de
ces
dames
qui
continuait
devant
la
cheminée
tous
deux
baissaient
la
voix
et
lon
aurait
cru
à
les
voir
cravatés
et
gantés
de
blanc
quils
traitaient
en
phrases
choisies
quelque
sujet
grave
donc
la
maman
muffat
que
la
faloise
avait
beaucoup
connue
était
une
vieille
insupportable
toujours
dans
les
curés
dailleurs
un
grand
air
un
geste
dautorité
qui
pliait
tout
devant
elle
quant
à
muffat
fils
tardif
dun
général
créé
comte
par
napoléon
ier
il
sétait
naturellement
trouvé
en
faveur
après
le
décembre
lui
aussi
manquait
de
gaieté
mais
il
passait
pour
un
très
honnête
homme
dun
esprit
droit
avec
ça
des
opinions
de
lautre
monde
et
une
si
haute
idée
de
sa
charge
à
la
cour
de
ses
dignités
et
de
ses
vertus
quil
portait
la
tête
comme
un
saintsacrement
cétait
la
maman
muffat
qui
lui
avait
donné
cette
belle
éducation
tous
les
jours
à
confesse
pas
descapades
pas
de
jeunesse
daucune
sorte
il
pratiquait
il
avait
des
crises
de
foi
dune
violence
sanguine
pareilles
à
des
accès
de
fièvre
chaude
enfin
pour
le
peindre
dun
dernier
détail
la
faloise
lâcha
un
mot
à
loreille
de
son
cousin
pas
possible
dit
ce
dernier
l
juré
parole
dhonneur
il
lavait
encore
quand
il
sest
marié
fauchery
riait
en
regardant
le
comte
dont
le
visage
encadré
de
favoris
sans
moustaches
semblait
plus
carré
et
plus
dur
depuis
quil
citait
des
chiffres
à
steiner
qui
se
débattait
foi
il
une
tête
à
ça
murmuratil
un
joli
cadeau
quil
fait
à
sa
femme
ah
la
pauvre
petite
atil
dû
lennuyer
elle
ne
sait
rien
de
rien
je
parie
justement
la
comtesse
sabine
lui
parlait
il
ne
lentendit
pas
tellement
il
trouvait
le
cas
de
muffat
plaisant
et
extraordinaire
elle
répéta
sa
question
monsieur
fauchery
estce
que
vous
navez
pas
publié
un
portrait
de
monsieur
de
bismarck
vous
lui
avez
parlé
il
se
leva
vivement
sapprocha
du
cercle
des
dames
tâchant
de
se
remettre
trouvant
dailleurs
une
réponse
avec
une
aisance
parfaite
mon
dieu
madame
je
vous
avouerai
que
jai
écrit
ce
portrait
sur
des
biographies
parues
en
allemagne
je
nai
jamais
vu
monsieur
de
bismarck
il
resta
près
de
la
comtesse
tout
en
causant
avec
elle
il
continuait
ses
réflexions
elle
ne
paraissait
pas
son
âge
lui
aurait
donné
au
plus
vingthuit
ans
ses
yeux
surtout
gardaient
une
flamme
de
jeunesse
que
de
longues
paupières
noyaient
dune
ombre
bleue
grandie
dans
un
ménage
désuni
passant
un
mois
près
du
marquis
de
chouard
et
un
mois
près
de
la
marquise
elle
sétait
mariée
très
jeune
à
la
mort
de
sa
mère
poussée
sans
doute
par
son
père
quelle
gênait
un
terrible
homme
le
marquis
et
sur
lequel
détranges
histoires
commençaient
à
courir
malgré
sa
haute
piété
fauchery
demanda
sil
naurait
pas
lhonneur
de
le
saluer
certainement
son
père
viendrait
mais
très
tard
il
avait
tant
de
travail
le
journaliste
qui
croyait
savoir
où
le
vieux
passait
ses
soirées
resta
grave
mais
un
signe
quil
aperçut
à
la
joue
gauche
de
la
comtesse
près
de
la
bouche
le
surprit
nana
avait
le
même
absolument
cétait
drôle
sur
le
signe
de
petits
poils
frisaient
seulement
les
poils
blonds
de
nana
étaient
chez
lautre
dun
noir
de
jais
nimporte
cette
femme
ne
couchait
avec
personne
jai
toujours
eu
envie
de
connaître
la
reine
augusta
disaitelle
assure
quelle
est
si
bonne
si
pieuse
croyezvous
quelle
accompagnera
le
roi
ne
le
pense
pas
madame
réponditil
elle
ne
couchait
avec
personne
cela
sautait
aux
yeux
il
suffisait
de
la
voir
là
près
de
sa
fille
si
nulle
et
si
guindée
sur
son
tabouret
ce
salon
sépulcral
exhalant
une
odeur
déglise
disait
assez
sous
quelle
main
de
fer
au
fond
de
quelle
existence
rigide
elle
restait
pliée
elle
navait
rien
mis
delle
dans
cette
demeure
antique
noire
dhumidité
cétait
muffat
qui
simposait
qui
dominait
avec
son
éducation
dévote
ses
pénitences
et
ses
jeûnes
mais
la
vue
du
petit
vieillard
aux
dents
mauvaises
et
au
sourire
fin
quil
découvrit
tout
dun
coup
dans
son
fauteuil
derrière
les
dames
fut
pour
lui
un
argument
plus
décisif
encore
il
connaissait
le
personnage
théophile
venot
un
ancien
avoué
qui
avait
eu
la
spécialité
des
procès
ecclésiastiques
il
sétait
retiré
avec
une
belle
fortune
il
menait
une
existence
assez
mystérieuse
reçu
partout
salué
très
bas
même
un
peu
craint
comme
sil
eût
représenté
une
grande
force
une
force
occulte
quon
sentait
derrière
lui
dailleurs
il
se
montrait
très
humble
il
était
marguillier
à
la
madeleine
et
avait
simplement
accepté
une
situation
dadjoint
à
la
mairie
du
neuvième
arrondissement
pour
occuper
ses
loisirs
disaitil
fichtre
la
comtesse

bien
entourée

fauchery
à
son
cousin
lorsquil

fut

du
cercle
des
dames

que

et
le
député

dans
un
coin
et
changeant
de

air
victorieux

mais

elle
l
dit
enfin
elle
donc
reçu
et
elle
invité
minuit
précis
après
le
théâtre
le
banquier
était
rayonnant
il
cligna
les
yeux
il
ajouta
en
donnant
aux
mots
une
valeur
particulière
ça
est
vous
quoi

dit
fauchery
qui
affecta
de
ne
pas
comprendre
elle

article

demain
le
journaliste
ouvrit
les
bras
comme
pour
déclarer
quon
navait
jamais
pu
savoir
mais
vandeuvres
appelait
steiner
qui
connaissait
de
bismarck
madame
du
joncquoy
était
presque
convaincue
elle
conclut
par
ces
mots
il
fait
une
mauvaise
impression
je
lui
trouve
le
visage
méchant
mais
je
veux
bien
croire
quil
beaucoup
desprit
cela
explique
ses
succès
sans
doute
dit
avec
un
pâle
sourire
le
banquier
un
juif
de
francfort
cependant
la
faloise
osait
cette
fois
interroger
son
cousin
le
poursuivant
lui
glissant
dans
le
cou
soupe
donc
chez
une
femme
demain
soir
chez
qui
hein
chez
qui
fauchery
fit
signe
quon
les
écoutait
il
fallait
être
convenable
de
nouveau
la
porte
venait
de
souvrir
et
une
vieille
dame
entrait
suivie
dun
jeune
homme
dans
lequel
le
journaliste
reconnut
léchappé
de
collège
qui
le
soir
de
la
blonde
vénus
avait
lancé
le
fameux
très
chic
dont
causait
encore
larrivée
de
cette
dame
remuait
le
salon
vivement
la
comtesse
sabine
sétait
levée
pour
savancer
à
sa
rencontre
et
elle
lui
avait
pris
les
deux
mains
elle
la
nommait
sa
chère
madame
hugon
voyant
son
cousin
regarder
curieusement
cette
scène
la
faloise
afin
de
le
toucher
le
mit
au
courant
en
quelques
mots
brefs
madame
hugon
veuve
dun
notaire
retirée
aux
fondettes
une
ancienne
propriété
de
sa
famille
près
dorléans
conservait
un
piedàterre
à
paris
dans
une
maison
quelle
possédait
rue
de
richelieu
passait
en
ce
moment
quelques
semaines
pour
installer
son
plus
jeune
fils
qui
faisait
sa
première
année
de
droit
était
autrefois
une
grande
amie
de
la
marquise
de
chouard
et
avait
vu
naître
la
comtesse
quelle
gardait
des
mois
entiers
chez
elle
avant
son
mariage
et
quelle
tutoyait
même
encore
je
tai
amené
georges
disait
madame
hugon
à
sabine
il
grandi
jespère
le
jeune
homme
avec
ses
yeux
clairs
et
ses
frisures
blondes
de
fille
déguisée
en
garçon
saluait
la
comtesse
sans
embarras
lui
rappelait
une
partie
de
volant
quils
avaient
faite
ensemble
deux
ans
plus
tôt
aux
fondettes
philippe
nest
pas
à
paris
demanda
le
comte
muffat
oh
non
répondit
la
vieille
dame
il
est
toujours
en
garnison
à
bourges
elle
sétait
assise
elle
parlait
orgueilleusement
de
son
fils
aîné
un
grand
gaillard
qui
après
sêtre
engagé
dans
un
coup
de
tête
venait
darriver
très
vite
au
grade
de
lieutenant
toutes
ces
dames
lentouraient
dune
respectueuse
sympathie
la
conversation
reprit
plus
aimable
et
plus
délicate
et
fauchery
à
voir
là
cette
respectable
madame
hugon
cette
figure
maternelle
éclairée
dun
si
bon
sourire
entre
ses
larges
bandeaux
de
cheveux
blancs
se
trouva
ridicule
davoir
soupçonné
un
instant
la
comtesse
sabine
pourtant
la
grande
chaise
de
soie
rouge
capitonnée
où
la
comtesse
sasseyait
venait
dattirer
son
attention
il
la
trouvait
dun
ton
brutal
dune
fantaisie
troublante
dans
ce
salon
enfumé
coup
sûr
ce
nétait
pas
le
comte
qui
avait
introduit
ce
meuble
de
voluptueuse
paresse
aurait
dit
un
essai
le
commencement
dun
désir
et
dune
jouissance
alors
il
soublia
rêvant
revenant
quand
même
à
cette
confidence
vague
reçue
un
soir
dans
le
cabinet
dun
restaurant
il
avait
désiré
sintroduire
chez
les
muffat
poussé
par
une
curiosité
sensuelle
puisque
son
ami
était
resté
au
mexique
qui
sait
il
fallait
voir
cétait
une
bêtise
sans
doute
seulement
lidée
le
tourmentait
il
se
sentait
attiré
son
vice
mis
en
éveil
la
grande
chaise
avait
une
mine
chiffonnée
un
renversement
de
dossier
qui
lamusaient
maintenant
eh
bien
partonsnous
demanda
la
faloise
en
se
promettant
dobtenir
dehors
le
nom
de
la
femme
chez
qui
soupait
tout
à
lheure
répondit
fauchery
et
il
ne
se
pressa
plus
il
se
donna
pour
prétexte
linvitation
quon
lavait
chargé
de
faire
et
qui
nétait
pas
commode
à
présenter
les
dames
causaient
dune
prise
de
voile
une
cérémonie
très
touchante
dont
le
paris
mondain
restait
tout
ému
depuis
trois
jours
cétait
la
fille
aînée
de
la
baronne
de
fougeray
qui
venait
dentrer
aux
carmélites
par
une
vocation
irrésistible
madame
chantereau
un
peu
cousine
des
fougeray
racontait
que
la
baronne
avait
dû
se
mettre
au
lit
le
lendemain
tellement
les
larmes
létouffaient
moi
jétais
très
bien
placée
déclara
léonide
jai
trouvé
ça
curieux
cependant
madame
hugon
plaignait
la
pauvre
mère
quelle
douleur
de
perdre
ainsi
sa
fille
maccuse
dêtre
dévote
ditelle
avec
sa
tranquille
franchise
cela
ne
mempêche
pas
de
trouver
bien
cruelles
les
enfants
qui
sentêtent
dans
un
pareil
suicide
oui
cest
une
terrible
chose
murmura
la
comtesse
avec
un
petit
grelottement
de
frileuse
en
se
pelotonnant
davantage
au
fond
de
sa
grande
chaise
devant
le
feu
alors
ces
dames
discutèrent
mais
leurs
voix
demeuraient
discrètes
de
légers
rires
par
moments
coupaient
la
gravité
de
la
conversation
les
deux
lampes
de
la
cheminée
recouvertes
dune
dentelle
rose
les
éclairaient
faiblement
et
il
n
avait
sur
des
meubles
éloignés
que
trois
autres
lampes
qui
laissaient
le
vaste
salon
dans
une
ombre
douce
steiner
sennuyait
il
racontait
à
fauchery
une
aventure
de
cette
petite
madame
de
chezelles
quil
appelait
léonide
tout
court
une
bougresse
disaitil
en
baissant
la
voix
derrière
les
fauteuils
des
dames
fauchery
la
regardait
dans
sa
grande
robe
de
satin
bleu
pâle
drôlement
posée
sur
un
coin
de
son
fauteuil
mince
et
hardie
comme
un
garçon
et
il
finissait
par
être
surpris
de
la
voir
là
se
tenait
mieux
chez
caroline
héquet
dont
la
mère
avait
sérieusement
monté
la
maison
cétait
tout
un
sujet
darticle
quel
singulier
monde
que
ce
monde
parisien
les
salons
les
plus
rigides
se
trouvaient
envahis
évidemment
ce
silencieux
théophile
venot
qui
se
contentait
de
sourire
en
montrant
ses
dents
mauvaises
devait
être
un
legs
de
la
défunte
comtesse
ainsi
que
les
dames
dâge
mûr
madame
chantereau
madame
du
joncquoy
et
quatre
ou
cinq
vieillards
immobiles
dans
les
angles
le
comte
muffat
amenait
des
fonctionnaires
ayant
cette
correction
de
tenue
quon
aimait
chez
les
hommes
aux
tuileries
entre
autres
le
chef
de
bureau
toujours
seul
au
milieu
de
la
pièce
la
face
rasée
et
les
regards
éteints
sanglé
dans
son
habit
au
point
de
ne
pouvoir
risquer
un
geste
presque
tous
les
jeunes
gens
et
quelques
personnages
de
hautes
manières
venaient
du
marquis
de
chouard
qui
avait
gardé
des
relations
suivies
dans
le
parti
légitimiste
après
sêtre
rallié
en
entrant
au
conseil
détat
restaient
léonide
de
chezelles
steiner
tout
un
coin
louche
sur
lequel
madame
hugon
tranchait
avec
sa
sérénité
de
vieille
femme
aimable
et
fauchery
qui
voyait
son
article
appelait
ça
le
coin
de
la
comtesse
sabine
une
autre
fois
continuait

plus
bas
léonide
fait
venir
son
ténor
à
montauban
elle
habitait
le
château
de
beaurecueil
deux
lieues
plus
loin
et
elle
arrivait
tous
les
jours
dans
une
calèche
attelée
de
deux
chevaux
pour
le
voir
au
liondor
où
il
était
descendu
la
voiture
attendait
à
la
porte
léonide
restait
des
heures
pendant
que
le
monde
se
rassemblait
et
regardait
les
chevaux
un
silence
sétait
fait
quelques
secondes
solennelles
passèrent
sous
le
haut
plafond
deux
jeunes
chuchotaient
mais
ils
se
turent
à
leur
tour
et
lon
nentendit
plus
que
le
pas
étouffé
du
comte
muffat
qui
traversait
la
pièce
les
lampes
semblaient
avoir
pâli
le
feu
séteignait
une
ombre
sévère
noyait
les
vieux
amis
de
la
maison
dans
les
fauteuils
quils
occupaient
là
depuis
quarante
ans
ce
fut
comme
si
entre
deux
phrases
échangées
les
invités
eussent
senti
revenir
la
mère
du
comte
avec
son
grand
air
glacial
déjà
la
comtesse
sabine
reprenait
enfin
le
bruit
en
couru
le
jeune
homme
serait
mort
et
cela
expliquerait
lentrée
en
religion
de
cette
pauvre
enfant
dit
dailleurs
que
jamais
monsieur
de
fougeray
naurait
consenti
au
mariage
dit
bien
dautres
choses
sécria
léonide
étourdiment
elle
se
mit
à
rire
tout
en
refusant
de
parler
sabine
gagnée
par
cette
gaieté
porta
son
mouchoir
à
ses
lèvres
et
ces
rires
dans
la
solennité
de
la
vaste
pièce
prenaient
un
son
dont
fauchery
resta
frappé
ils
sonnaient
le
cristal
qui
se
brise
certainement
il
avait
là
un
commencement
de
fêlure
toutes
les
voix
repartirent
madame
du
joncquoy
protestait
madame
chantereau
savait
quon
avait
projeté
un
mariage
mais
que
les
choses
en
étaient
restées
là
les
hommes
euxmêmes
risquaient
leur
avis
ce
fut
pendant
quelques
minutes
une
confusion
de
jugements
où
les
divers
éléments
du
salon
les
bonapartistes
et
les
légitimistes
mêlés
aux
sceptiques
mondains
donnaient
à
la
fois
et
se
coudoyaient
estelle
avait
sonné
pour
quon
mît
du
bois
au
feu
le
valet
remontait
les
lampes
eût
dit
un
réveil
fauchery
souriait
comme
mis
à
laise
parbleu
elles
épousent
dieu
lorsquelles
nont
pu
épouser
leur
cousin
dit
entre
ses
dents
vandeuvres
que
cette
question
ennuyait
et
qui
venait
rejoindre
fauchery
mon
cher
avezvous
jamais
vu
une
femme
aimée
se
faire
religieuse
il
nattendit
pas
la
réponse
il
en
avait
assez
et
à
demivoix
dites
donc
combien
seronsnous
demain
il
aura
les
mignon
steiner
vous
blanche
et
moi
qui
encore
caroline
je
pense
simonne
gaga
sans
doute
ne
sait
jamais
au
juste
nestce
pas
dans
ces
occasions
croit
être
vingt
et
lon
est
trente
vandeuvres
qui
regardait
les
dames
sauta
brusquement
à
un
autre
sujet
elle
dû
être
très
bien
cette
dame
du
joncquoy
il
quinze
ans
la
pauvre
estelle
sest
encore
allongée
en
voilà
une
jolie
planche
à
mettre
dans
un
lit
mais
il
sinterrompit
il
revint
au
souper
du
lendemain
ce
quil
dennuyeux
dans
ces
machineslà
cest
que
ce
sont
toujours
les
mêmes
femmes
il
faudrait
du
nouveau
tâchez
donc
den
inviter
une
tiens
une
idée
je
vais
prier
ce
gros
homme
damener
la
femme
quil
promenait
lautre
soir
aux
variétés
il
parlait
du
chef
de
bureau
ensommeillé
au
milieu
du
salon
fauchery
samusa
de
loin
à
suivre
cette
négociation
délicate
vandeuvres
sétait
assis
près
du
gros
homme
qui
restait
très
digne
tous
deux
parurent
un
instant
discuter
avec
mesure
la
question
pendante
celle
de
savoir
quel
sentiment
véritable
poussait
une
jeune
fille
à
entrer
en
religion
puis
le
comte
revint
disant
ce
nest
pas
possible
il
jure
quelle
est
sage
elle
refuserait
jaurais
pourtant
parié
lavoir
vue
chez
laure
comment
vous
allez
chez
laure
murmura
fauchery
en
riant
vous
vous
risquez
dans
des
endroits
pareils
je
croyais
quil
n
avait
que
nous
autres
pauvres
diables
eh
mon
cher
il
faut
bien
tout
connaître
alors
ils
ricanèrent
les
yeux
luisants
se
donnant
des
détails
sur
la
table
dhôte
de
la
rue
des
martyrs
où
la
grosse
laure
piédefer
pour
trois
francs
faisait
manger
les
petites
femmes
dans
lembarras
un
joli
trou
toutes
les
petites
femmes
baisaient
laure
sur
la
bouche
et
comme
la
comtesse
sabine
tournait
la
tête
ayant
saisi
un
mot
au
passage
ils
se
reculèrent
se
frottant
lun
contre
lautre
égayés
allumés
près
deux
ils
navaient
pas
remarqué
georges
hugon
qui
les
écoutait
en
rougissant
si
fort
quun
flot
rose
allait
de
ses
oreilles
à
son
cou
de
fille
ce
bébé
était
plein
de
honte
et
de
ravissement
depuis
que
sa
mère
lavait
lâché
dans
le
salon
il
tournait
derrière
madame
de
chezelles
la
seule
femme
qui
lui
parût
chic
et
encore
nana
lenfonçait
joliment
hier
soir
disait
madame
hugon
georges
menée
au
théâtre
oui
aux
variétés
où
je
navais
certainement
plus
mis
les
pieds
depuis
dix
ans
cet
enfant
adore
la
musique
moi
ça
ne
guère
amusée
mais
il
était
si
heureux
fait
des
pièces
singulières
aujourdhui
dailleurs
la
musique
passionne
peu
je
lavoue
comment
madame
vous
naimez
pas
la
musique
sécria
madame
du
joncquoy
en
levant
les
yeux
au
ciel
estil
possible
quon
naime
pas
la
musique
ce
fut
une
exclamation
générale
personne
nouvrit
la
bouche
de
cette
pièce
des
variétés
à
laquelle
la
bonne
madame
hugon
navait
rien
compris
ces
dames
la
connaissaient
mais
elles
nen
parlaient
pas
tout
de
suite
se
jeta
dans
le
sentiment
dans
une
admiration
raffinée
et
extatique
des
maîtres
madame
du
joncquoy
naimait
que
weber
madame
chantereau
tenait
pour
les
italiens
les
voix
de
ces
dames
sétaient
faites
molles
et
languissantes
eût
dit
devant
la
cheminée
un
recueillement
déglise
le
cantique
discret
et
pâmé
dune
petite
chapelle
voyons
murmura
vandeuvres
en
ramenant
fauchery
au
milieu
du
salon
il
faut
pourtant
que
nous
inventions
une
femme
pour
demain
si
nous
demandions
à
steiner
oh
steiner
dit
le
journaliste
quand
il
une
femme
cest
que
paris
nen
veut
plus
vandeuvres
cependant
cherchait
autour
de
lui
attendez
repritil
jai
rencontré
lautre
jour
foucarmont
avec
une
blonde
charmante
je
vais
lui
dire
quil
lamène
et
il
appela
foucarmont
rapidement
ils
échangèrent
quelques
mots
une
complication
dut
se
présenter
car
tous
deux
marchant
avec
précaution
enjambant
les
jupes
des
dames
sen
allèrent
trouver
un
autre
jeune
homme
avec
lequel
ils
continuèrent
lentretien
dans
lembrasure
dune
fenêtre
fauchery
resté
seul
se
décidait
à
sapprocher
de
la
cheminée
au
moment
où
madame
du
joncquoy
déclarait
quelle
ne
pouvait
entendre
jouer
du
weber
sans
voir
aussitôt
des
lacs
des
forêts
des
levers
de
soleil
sur
des
campagnes
trempées
de
rosée
mais
une
main
le
toucha
à
lépaule
tandis
quune
voix
disait
derrière
lui
ce
nest
pas
gentil
quoi
donc
demandatil
en
se
tournant
et
en
reconnaissant
la
faloise
ce
souper
pour
demain
tu
aurais
bien
pu
faire
inviter
fauchery
allait
enfin
répondre
lorsque
vandeuvres
revint
lui
dire
il
paraît
que
ce
nest
pas
une
femme
à
foucarmont
cest
le
collage
de
ce
monsieur
làbas
elle
ne
pourra
pas
venir
quelle
déveine
mais
jai
racolé
tout
de

en

il

à

je

alors
le
vit
aimable
souriant
aborder
les
hommes
et
causer
aux
quatre
coins
du
salon
il
se
mêlait
aux
groupes
glissait
une
phrase
dans
le
cou
de
chacun
se
retournait
avec
des
clignements

et
des

que
les
dissertations

couvraient
le
petit

fiévreux
de
cet
embauchage
non
ne

répétait
madame

le
chant

la

cest
la

avezvous
entendu
la

dans
le
barbier
délicieuse
murmura
léonide
qui
ne
tapait
que
des
airs
dopérette
sur
son
piano
la
comtesse
sabine
cependant
avait
sonné
lorsque
les
visiteurs
étaient
peu
nombreux
le
mardi
servait
le
thé
dans
le
salon
même
tout
en
faisant
débarrasser
un
guéridon
par
un
valet
la
comtesse
suivait
des
yeux
le
comte
de
vandeuvres
elle
gardait
ce
sourire
vague
qui
montrait
un
peu
de
la
blancheur
de
ses
dents
et
comme
le
comte
passait
elle
le
questionna
que
complotezvous
donc
monsieur
de
vandeuvres
moi
madame
réponditil
tranquillement
je
ne
complote
rien
ah
je
vous
voyais
si
affairé
tenez
vous
allez
vous
rendre
utile
elle
lui
mit
dans
les
mains
un
album
en
le
priant
de
le
porter
sur
le
piano
mais
il
trouva
moyen
dapprendre
tout
bas
à
fauchery
quon
aurait
tatan
néné
la
plus
belle
gorge
de
lhiver
et
maria
blond
celle
qui
venait
de
débuter
aux
foliesdramatiques
cependant
la
faloise
larrêtait
à
chaque
pas
attendant
une
invitation
il
finit
par
soffrir
vandeuvres
lengagea
tout
de
suite
seulement
il
lui
fit
promettre
damener
clarisse
et
comme
la
faloise
affectait
de
montrer
des
scrupules
il
le
tranquillisa
en
disant
puisque
je
vous
invite
ça
suffit
la
faloise
aurait
pourtant
bien
voulu
savoir
le
nom
de
la
femme
mais
la
comtesse
avait
rappelé
vandeuvres
quelle
interrogeait
sur
la
façon
dont
les
anglais
faisaient
le
thé
il
se
rendait
souvent
en
angleterre
où
ses
chevaux
couraient
selon
lui
les
russes
seuls
savaient
faire
le
thé
et
il
indiqua
leur
recette
puis
comme
sil
eût
continué
tout
un
travail
intérieur
pendant
quil
parlait
il
sinterrompit
pour
demander
propos
et
le
marquis
estce
que
nous
ne
devions
pas
le
voir
mais
si
mon
père
mavait
promis
formellement
répondit
la
comtesse
je
commence
à
être
inquiète
ses
travaux
lauront
retenu
vandeuvres
eut
un
sourire
discret
lui
aussi
paraissait
se
douter
de
quelle
nature
étaient
les
travaux
du
marquis
de
chouard
il
avait
songé
à
une
belle
personne
que
le
marquis
menait
parfois
à
la
campagne
peutêtre
pourraiton
lavoir
cependant
fauchery
jugea
que
le
moment
était
arrivé
de
risquer
linvitation
au
comte
muffat
la
soirée
savançait
sérieusement
demanda
vandeuvres
qui
croyait
à
une
plaisanterie
très
sérieusement
si
je
ne
fais
pas
commission
elle
marrachera
les
yeux
une
toquade
vous
savez
alors
je
vais
vous
aider
mon
cher
onze
heures
sonnaient
la
comtesse
aidée
de
sa
fille
servait
le
thé
comme
il
nétait
guère
venu
que
des
intimes
les
tasses
et
les
assiettes
de
petits
gâteaux
circulaient
familièrement
même
les
dames
ne
quittaient
pas
leurs
fauteuils
devant
le
feu
buvant
à
légères
gorgées
croquant
les
gâteaux
du
bout
des
doigts
de
la
musique
la
causerie
était
tombée
aux
fournisseurs
il
n
avait
que
boissier
pour
les
fondants
et
que
catherine
pour
les
glaces
cependant
madame
chantereau
soutenait
latinville
les
paroles
se
faisaient
plus
lentes
une
lassitude
endormait
le
salon
steiner
sétait
remis
à
travailler
sourdement
le
député
quil
tenait
bloqué
dans
le
coin
dune
causeuse
venot
dont
les
sucreries
devaient
avoir
gâté
les
dents
mangeait
des
gâteaux
secs
coup
sur
coup
avec
un
petit
bruit
de
souris
tandis
que
le
chef
de
bureau
le
nez
dans
une
tasse
nen
finissait
plus
et
la
comtesse
sans
hâte
allait
de
lun
à
lautre
ninsistant
pas
restant
là
quelques
secondes
à
regarder
les
hommes
dun
air
dinterrogation
muette
puis
souriant
et
passant
le
grand
feu
lavait
rendue
toute
rose
elle
semblait
être
la
soeur
de
sa
fille
si
sèche
et
si
gauche
auprès
delle
comme
elle
sapprochait
de
fauchery
qui
causait
avec
son
mari
et
vandeuvres
elle
remarqua
quon
se
taisait
et
elle
ne
sarrêta
pas
elle
donna
plus
loin
à
georges
hugon
la
tasse
de
thé
quelle
offrait
cest
une
dame
qui
désire
vous
avoir
à
souper
reprit
gaiement
le
journaliste
en
sadressant
au
comte
muffat
celuici
dont
la
face
était
restée
grise
toute
la
soirée
parut
très
surpris
quelle
dame
eh
nana
dit
vandeuvres
pour
brusquer
linvitation
le
comte
devint
plus
grave
il
eut
à
peine
un
battement
de
paupières
pendant
quun
malaise
comme
une
ombre
de
migraine
passait
sur
son
front
mais
je
ne
connais
pas
cette
dame
murmuratil
voyons
vous
êtes
allé
chez
elle
fit
remarquer
vandeuvres
comment
je
suis
allé
chez
elle
ah
oui
lautre
jour
pour
le
bureau
de
bienfaisance
je
n
songeais
plus
nimporte
je
ne
la
connais
pas
je
ne
puis
accepter
il
avait
pris
un
air
glacé
pour
leur
faire
entendre
que
cette
plaisanterie
lui
semblait
de
mauvais
goût
la
place
dun
homme
de
son
rang
nétait
pas
à
la
table
dune
de
ces
femmes
vandeuvres
se
récria
il
sagissait
dun
souper
dartistes
le
talent
excusait
tout
mais
sans
écouter
davantage
les
arguments
de
fauchery
qui
racontait
un
dîner
où
le
prince
décosse
un
fils
de
reine
sétait
assis
à
côté
dune
ancienne
chanteuse
de
caféconcert
le
comte
accentua
son
refus
même
il
laissa
échapper
un
geste
dirritation
malgré
sa
grande
politesse
georges
et
la
faloise
en
train
de
boire
leur
tasse
de
thé
debout
lun
devant
lautre
avaient
entendu
les
quelques
paroles
échangées
près
deux
tiens
cest
donc
chez
nana
murmura
la
faloise
jaurais
dû
men
douter
georges
ne
disait
rien
mais
il
flambait
ses
cheveux
blonds
envolés
ses
yeux
bleus
luisant
comme
des
chandelles
tant
le
vice
où
il
marchait
depuis
quelques
jours
lallumait
et
le
soulevait
enfin
il
entrait
donc
dans
tout
ce
quil
avait
rêvé
cest
que
je
ne
sais
pas
ladresse
reprit
la
faloise
boulevard
haussmann
entre
la
rue
de
larcade
et
la
rue
pasquier
au
troisième
étage
dit
georges
tout
dun
trait
et
comme
lautre
le
regardait
avec
étonnement
il
ajouta
très
rouge
crevant
de
fatuité
et
dembarras
jen
suis
elle
invité
ce
matin
mais
un
grand
mouvement
avait
lieu
dans
le
salon
vandeuvres
et
fauchery
ne
purent
insister
davantage
auprès
du
comte
le
marquis
de
chouard
venait
dentrer
chacun
sempressait
il
sétait
avancé
péniblement
les
jambes
molles
et
il
restait
au
milieu
de
la
pièce
blême
les
yeux
clignotants
comme
sil
sortait
de
quelque
ruelle
sombre
aveuglé
par
la
clarté
des
lampes
je
nespérais
plus
vous
voir
mon
père
dit
la
comtesse
jaurais
été
inquiète
jusqu
à
demain
il
la
regarda
sans
répondre
de
lair
dun
homme
qui
ne
comprend
pas
son
nez
très
gros
dans
sa
face
rasée
semblait
la
boursouflure
dun
mal
blanc
tandis
que
sa
lèvre
inférieure
pendait
madame
hugon
en
le
voyant
si
accablé
le
plaignit
pleine
de
charité
vous
travaillez
trop
vous
devriez
vous
reposer
nos
âges
il
faut
laisser
le
travail
aux
jeunes
gens
le
travail
ah
oui
le
travail
bégayatil
enfin
toujours
beaucoup
de
travail
il
se
remettait
il
redressait
sa
taille
voûtée
passant
la
main
dun
geste
qui
lui
était
familier
sur
ses
cheveux
blancs
dont
les
rares
boucles
flottaient
derrière
ses
oreilles
quoi
travaillezvous
donc
si
tard
demanda
madame
du
joncquoy
je
vous
croyais
à
la
réception
du
ministre
des
finances
mais
la
comtesse
intervint
mon
père
avait
à
étudier
un
projet
de
loi
oui
un
projet
de
loi
ditil
un
projet
de
loi
précisément
je
métais
enfermé
cest
au
sujet
des
fabriques
je
voudrais
quon
observât
le
repos
dominical
il
est
vraiment
honteux
que
le
gouvernement
ne
veuille
pas
agir
avec
vigueur
les
églises
se
vident
nous
allons
à
des
catastrophes
vandeuvres
avait
regardé
fauchery
tous
deux
se
trouvaient
derrière
le
marquis
et
ils
le
flairaient
lorsque
vandeuvres
put
le
prendre
à
part
pour
lui
parler
de
cette
belle
personne
quil
menait
à
la
campagne
le
vieillard
affecta
une
grande
surprise
peutêtre
lavaiton
vu
avec
la
baronne
decker
chez
laquelle
il
passait
parfois
quelques
jours
à
viroflay
vandeuvres
pour
seule
vengeance
lui
demanda
brusquement
dites
donc
où
avezvous
passé
votre
coude
est
plein
de
toiles
daraignée
et
de
plâtre
mon
coude
murmuratil
légèrement
troublé
tiens
cest
vrai
un
peu
de
saleté
jaurai
attrapé
ça
en
descendant
de
chez
moi
plusieurs
personnes
sen
allaient
il
était
près
de
minuit
deux
valets
enlevaient
sans
bruit
les
tasses
vides
et
les
assiettes
de
gâteaux
devant
la
cheminée
ces
dames
avaient
reformé
et
rétréci
leur
cercle
causant
avec
plus
dabandon
dans
la
langueur
de
cette
fin
de
soirée
le
salon
luimême
sensommeillait
des
ombres
lentes
tombaient
des
murs
alors
fauchery
parla
de
se
retirer
pourtant
il
soubliait
de
nouveau
à
regarder
la
comtesse
sabine
elle
se
reposait
de
ses
soins
de
maîtresse
de
maison
à
sa
place
accoutumée
muette
les
yeux
sur
un
tison
qui
se
consumait
en
braise
le
visage
si
blanc
et
si
fermé
quil
était
repris
de
doute
dans
la
lueur
du
foyer
les
poils
noirs
du
signe
quelle
avait
au
coin
des
lèvres
blondissaient
absolument
le
signe
de
nana
jusqu
à
la
couleur
il
ne
put
sempêcher
den
dire
un
mot
à
loreille
de
vandeuvres
cétait
foi
vrai
jamais
celuici
ne
lavait
remarqué
et
tous
les
deux
continuèrent
le
parallèle
entre
nana
et
la
comtesse
ils
leur
trouvaient
une
vague
ressemblance
dans
le
menton
et
dans
la
bouche
mais
les
yeux
nétaient
pas
du
tout
pareils
puis
nana
avait
lair
bonne
fille
tandis
quon
ne
savait
pas
avec
la
comtesse
aurait
dit
une
chatte
qui
dormait
les
griffes
rentrées
les
pattes
à
peine
agitées
dun
frisson
nerveux
tout
de
même
coucherait
avec
déclara
fauchery
vandeuvres
la
déshabillait
du
regard
oui
tout
de
même
ditil
mais
vous
savez
je
défie
des
cuisses
elle
n
pas
de
cuisses
voulezvous
parier
il
se
tut
fauchery
lui
touchait
vivement
le
coude
en
montrant
dun
signe
estelle
assise
sur
son
tabouret
devant
eux
ils
venaient
de
hausser
le
ton
sans
la
remarquer
et
elle
devait
les
avoir
entendus
cependant
elle
restait
raide
immobile
avec
son
cou
maigre
de
fille
poussée
trop
vite
où
pas
un
petit
cheveu
navait
bougé
alors
ils
séloignèrent
de
trois
ou
quatre
pas
vandeuvres
jurait
que
la
comtesse
était
une
très
honnête
femme
ce
moment
les
voix
sélevèrent
devant
la
cheminée
madame
du
joncquoy
disait
je
vous
ai
accordé
que
monsieur
de
bismarck
était
peutêtre
un
homme
desprit
seulement
si
vous
allez
jusquau
génie
ces
dames
en
étaient
revenues
à
leur
premier
sujet
de
conversation
comment
encore
monsieur
de
bismarck
murmura
fauchery
cette
fois
je
sauve
pour
tout
de
bon
attendez
dit
vandeuvres
il
nous
faut
un
non
définitif
du
comte
le
comte
muffat
causait
avec
son
beaupère
et
quelques
hommes
graves
vandeuvres
lemmena
renouvela
linvitation
en
lappuyant
en
disant
quil
était
luimême
du
souper
un
homme
pouvait
aller
partout
personne
ne
songerait
à
voir
du
mal
où
il
aurait
au
plus
de
la
curiosité
le
comte
écoutait
ces
arguments
les
yeux
baissés
la
face
muette
vandeuvres
sentait
en
lui
une
hésitation
lorsque
le
marquis
de
chouard
sapprocha
dun
air
interrogateur
et
quand
ce
dernier
sut
de
quoi
il
sagissait
quand
fauchery
linvita
à
son
tour
il
regarda
furtivement
son
gendre
il
eut
un
silence
une
gêne
mais
tous
deux
sencourageaient
ils
auraient
sans
doute
fini
par
accepter
si
le
comte
muffat
navait
aperçu
venot
qui
le
regardait
fixement
le
petit
vieillard
ne
souriait
plus
il
avait
un
visage
terreux
des
yeux
dacier
clairs
et
aigus
non
répondit
le
comte
aussitôt
dun
ton
si
net
quil
n
avait
pas
à
insister
alors
le
marquis
refusa
avec
plus
de
sévérité
encore
il
parla
morale
les
hautes
classes
devaient
lexemple
fauchery
eut
un
sourire
et
donna
une
poignée
de
main
à
vandeuvres
il
ne
lattendait
pas
il
partait
tout
de
suite
car
il
devait
passer
à
son
journal
chez
nana
à
minuit
nestce
pas
la
faloise
se
retirait
également
steiner
venait
de
saluer
la
comtesse
dautres
hommes
les
suivaient
et
les
mêmes
mots
couraient
chacun
répétait
minuit
chez
nana
en
allant
prendre
son
paletot
dans
lantichambre
georges
qui
ne
devait
partir
quavec
sa
mère
sétait
placé
sur
le
seuil
où
il
indiquait
ladresse
exacte
troisième
étage
la
porte
à
gauche
cependant
avant
de
sortir
fauchery
jeta
un
dernier
coup
doeil
vandeuvres
avait
repris
sa
place
au
milieu
des
dames
plaisantant
avec
léonide
de
chezelles
le
comte
muffat
et
le
marquis
de
chouard
se
mêlaient
à
la
conversation
pendant
que
la
bonne
madame
hugon
sendormait
les
yeux
ouverts
perdu
derrière
les
jupes
venot
redevenu
tout
petit
avait
retrouvé
son
sourire
minuit
sonnèrent
lentement
dans
la
vaste
pièce
solennelle
comment
comment
reprenait
madame
du
joncquoy
vous
supposez
que
monsieur
de
bismarck
nous
fera
la
guerre
et
nous
battra
oh
cellelà
dépasse
tout
riait
en
effet
autour
de
madame
chantereau
qui
venait
de
répéter
ce
propos
entendu
par
elle
en
alsace
où
son
mari
possédait
une
usine
lempereur
est
là
heureusement
dit
le
comte
muffat
avec
sa
gravité
officielle
ce
fut
le
dernier
mot
que
fauchery
put
entendre
il
refermait
la
porte
après
avoir
regardé
une
fois
encore
la
comtesse
sabine
elle
causait
posément
avec
le
chef
de
bureau
et
semblait
sintéresser
à
lentretien
de
ce
gros
homme
décidément
il
devait
sêtre
trompé
il
n
avait
point
de
fêlure
cétait
dommage
eh
bien
tu
ne
descends
pas
lui
cria
la
faloise
du
vestibule
et
sur
le
trottoir
en
se
séparant
répéta
encore
demain
chez
nana
iv
depuis
le
matin
zoé

livré
lappartement
à
un
maître
dhôtel
venu
de
chez

tout
fournir

fleurs
jusqu
à
des
sièges
et
à
des
tabourets

trouvé
une
douzaine
de
serviettes
au
fond
de
ses
armoires
et
nayant
pas
encore
eu
le
temps
de
se
monter
dans
son
nouveau
lançage
dédaignant
daller
au
restaurant
elle
avait
préféré
faire
venir
le
restaurant
chez
elle
ça
lui
semblait
plus
chic
elle
voulait
fêter
son
grand
succès
dactrice
par
un
souper
dont
parlerait
comme
la
salle
à
manger
était
trop
petite
le
maître
dhôtel
avait
dressé
la
table
dans
le
salon
une
table
où
tenaient
vingtcinq
couverts
un
peu
serrés
tout
est
prêt
demanda
nana
en
rentrant
à
minuit
ah

ne

répondit
brutalement
zoé
qui
paraissait
hors
delle
dieu
merci
je
ne
moccupe
de
rien
ils
en
font
un
massacre
dans
la
cuisine
et
dans
tout
lappartement
avec
ça
il
fallu

dans

où
ils
accrochaient
leurs
paletots
tous
deux
sétaient
rencontrés
à
la
sortie
des
artistes

des
panoramas
et
elle
les
avait
amenés
en
fiacre
comme
il
n

personne

elle
leur
criait
dentrer
dans
le
cabinet
de

pendant
que

se
fit
relever

des
roses
blanches
à
son
chignon
et
à
son
corsage
le
cabinet

trouvait
encombré
des
meubles
du
salon
quon
avait
dû
rouler
là
un
tas
de
guéridons
de
canapés
de
fauteuils
les
pieds
en
lair
et
elle
était
prête
lorsque
sa
jupe
se
prit
dans
une
roulette
et
se
fendit
alors
elle
jura
furieuse
ces
choses
narrivaient
qu
à
elle
rageusement
elle
ôta
sa
robe
une
robe
de
foulard
blanc
très
simple
si
souple
et
si
fine
quelle
lhabillait
dune
longue
chemise
mais
aussitôt
elle
la
remit
nen
trouvant
pas
dautre
à
son
goût
pleurant
presque
se
disant
faite
comme
une
chiffonnière
daguenet
et
georges
durent
rentrer

déchirure
avec
des
épingles
tandis
que

recoiffait
tous

se
hâtaient
autour
delle
le
petit
surtout
à
genoux
par
terre
les
mains
dans
les
jupes
elle
finit
par
se
calmer
lorsque
daguenet
lui
assura
quil
devait
être
au
plus
minuit
un
quart
tellement
elle
avait
dépêché
le
troisième
acte
de
la
blonde

par

la
queue
de
son
habit
balayant
le
sol
il
rougit
en
voyant
daguenet
le
regarder
cependant
ils
sétaient
pris
de
tendresse
lun
pour
lautre
ils
refirent
le
noeud
de
leur
cravate
devant
la
grande
psyché
et
se
donnèrent
mutuellement
un
coup
de
brosse
tout
blancs
de
sêtre
frottés
à
nana
dirait
du
sucre
murmura
georges
avec
son
rire
de
bébé
gourmand
un
laquais
loué
à
la
nuit
introduisait
les
invités
dans
le
petit
salon
une
pièce
étroite
où
lon
avait
laissé
quatre
fauteuils
seulement
pour
entasser
le
monde
du
grand
salon
voisin
venait
un
bruit
de
vaisselle
et
dargenterie
remuées
tandis
que
sous
la
porte
une
raie
de
vive
clarté
luisait
nana
en
entrant
trouva
déjà
installée
dans
un
des
fauteuils
clarisse
besnus
que
la
faloise
avait
amenée
comment
tu
es
la
première
dit
nana
qui
la
traitait
familièrement
depuis
son
succès
eh

lui
répondit
clarisse
il
toujours
peur
de
ne
pas
arriver
si
je
lavais
cru
je
naurais
pas
pris
le
temps
dôter
mon
rouge
et
perruque
le
jeune
homme
qui
voyait
nana
pour
la
première
fois
sinclinait
et
la
complimentait
parlant
de
son
cousin
cachant
son
trouble
sous
une
exagération
de
politesse
mais
nana
sans
lécouter
sans
le
connaître
lui
serra
la
main
puis
savança
vivement
vers
rose
mignon
du
coup
elle
devint
très
distinguée
ah
chère
madame
que
vous
êtes
gentille
je
tenais
tant
à
vous
avoir
cest
moi
qui

poche

et
mignon
étaient
entrés
derrière
rose
le
banquier
retourna
reparut
avec
léventail
pendant
que
mignon
fraternellement
embrassait
nana
et
forçait
rose
à
lembrasser
aussi
estce
quon
nétait
pas
tous
de
la
même
famille
au
théâtre
puis
il
cligna
des
yeux
comme
pour
encourager
steiner
mais
celuici
troublé
par
le
regard
clair
de
rose
se
contenta
de
mettre
un
baiser
sur
la
main
de
nana
ce
moment
le
comte
de
vandeuvres
parut
avec
blanche
de
sivry
il
eut
de
grandes
révérences
nana
tout
à
fait
cérémonieuse
mena
blanche
à
un
fauteuil
cependant
vandeuvres
racontait
en
riant
que
fauchery
se
disputait
en
bas
parce
que
le
concierge
avait
refusé
de
laisser
entrer
la
voiture
de
lucy
stewart
dans
lantichambre
entendit
lucy
qui
traitait
le
concierge
de
sale
mufe
mais
quand
le
laquais
eut
ouvert
la
porte
elle
savança
avec
sa
grâce
rieuse
se
nomma
ellemême
prit
les
deux
mains
de
nana
en
lui
disant
quelle
lavait
aimée
tout
de
suite
et
quelle
lui
trouvait
un
fier
talent
nana
gonflée
de
son
rôle
nouveau
de
maîtresse
de
maison
remerciait
vraiment
confuse
pourtant
elle
semblait
préoccupée
depuis
larrivée
de
fauchery
dès
quelle
put
sapprocher
de
lui
elle
demanda
tout
bas
viendratil
non
il
n
pas

répondit
brutalement
le
journaliste
pris
à
limproviste
bien
quil
eût
préparé
une
histoire
pour
expliquer
le
refus
du
comte
muffat
il
eut
conscience
de
sa
bêtise
en
voyant
la
pâleur
de
la
jeune
femme
et
tâcha
de
rattraper
sa
phrase
il
n
pas
pu
il
mène
ce
soir
la
comtesse
au
bal
du
ministère
de
lintérieur
cest
bon
murmura
nana
qui
le
soupçonnait
de
mauvaise
volonté
tu
paieras
ça
mon
petit
ah
dis
donc
repritil
blessé
de
la
menace
je
naime

ces
commissionslà
adressetoi
à
labordette
ils
se
tournèrent
le
dos
ils
étaient
fâchés
justement
mignon
poussait
steiner
contre
nana
lorsque
celleci
fut
seule
il
lui
dit
à
voix
basse
avec
un
cynisme
bon
enfant
de
compère
qui
veut
le
plaisir
dun
ami
vous
savez
quil
en
meurt
seulement
il
peur
de

nestce

que

défendrez
nana
neut
pas
lair
de

elle
souriait
elle
regardait
rose
son
mari
et
le
banquier
puis
elle
dit
à
ce
dernier
monsieur
steiner
vous
vous
mettrez
à
côté
de
moi
mais
des
rires
vinrent
de
lantichambre
des
chuchotements
une
bouffée
de
voix
gaies
et
bavardes
comme
si
tout
un
couvent
échappé
se
fût
trouvé
là
et
labordette
parut
traînant
cinq
femmes
derrière
lui
son
pensionnat
selon
le
mot
méchant
de
lucy
stewart
il
avait
gaga
majestueuse
dans
une
robe
de
velours
bleu
qui
la
sanglait
caroline
héquet
toujours
en
faille
noire
garnie
de
chantilly
puis
léa
de
horn
fagotée
comme
à
son
habitude
la
grosse
tatan
néné
une
blonde
bon
enfant
à
poitrine
de
nourrice
dont
se
moquait
enfin
la
petite
maria
blond
une
fillette
de
quinze
ans
dune
maigreur
et
dun
vice
de
gamin
que
lançait
son
début
aux
folies
labordette
avait
amené
tout
ça
dans
une
seule
voiture
et
elles
riaient
encore
davoir
été
serrées
maria
blond
sur
les
genoux
des
autres
mais
elles
pincèrent
les
lèvres
échangeant
des
poignées
de
main
et
des
saluts
toutes
très
comme
il
faut
gaga
faisait
lenfant
zézayait
par
excès
de
bonne
tenue
seule
tatan
néné
à
qui
lon
avait
raconté
en
chemin
que
six
nègres
absolument
nus
serviraient
le
souper
de
nana
sinquiétait
demandant
à
les
voir
labordette
la
traita
de
dinde
en
la
priant
de
se
taire
et
bordenave
demanda
fauchery

ne
pourra
pas
être
des
nôtres
oui
dit
rose
mignon
son
pied
sest
pris
dans
une
trappe
il
une
entorse
abominable
si
vous
lentendiez
jurer
la
jambe
ficelée
et
allongée
sur
une
chaise
alors
tout
le
monde
regretta
bordenave
ne
donnait
pas
un
bon
souper
sans
bordenave
enfin
tâcherait
de
se
passer
de
lui
et
lon
causait
déjà
dautre
chose
lorsquune
grosse
voix
séleva
quoi
donc
quoi
donc
cest
comme
ça
quon
menterre
il
eut
un
cri
chacun
tourna
la
tête
cétait
bordenave
énorme
et
très
rouge
la
jambe
raide
debout
sur
le
seuil
où
il
sappuyait
à
lépaule
de
simonne
cabiroche
pour
linstant
il
couchait
avec
simonne
cette
petite
qui
avait
reçu
de
léducation
jouant
du
piano
parlant
anglais
était
une
blonde
toute
mignonne
si
délicate
quelle
pliait
sous
le
rude
poids
de
bordenave
souriante
et
soumise
pourtant
il
posa
quelques
secondes
sentant
quils
faisaient
tableau
tous
les
deux
hein
il
faut
vous
aimer
continuatil
foi
jai
eu
peur
de
membêter
je
suis
dit
j
vais
mais
il
sinterrompit
pour
lâcher
un
juron
cré
nom
de
dieu
simonne
avait
fait
un
pas
trop
vite
son
pied
venait
de
porter
il
la
bouscula
elle
sans
cesser
de
sourire
baissant
son
joli
visage
comme
une
bête
qui
peur
dêtre
battue
le
soutenait
de
toutes
ses
forces
de
petite
blonde
potelée
dailleurs
au
milieu
des
exclamations
sempressait
nana
et
rose
mignon
roulaient
un
fauteuil
dans
lequel
bordenave
se
laissa
aller
pendant
que
les
autres
femmes
lui
glissaient
un
second
fauteuil
sous
la
jambe
et
toutes
les
actrices
qui
étaient
là
lembrassèrent
naturellement
il
grognait
il
soupirait
cré
nom
de
dieu
cré
nom
de
dieu
enfin
lestomac
est
solide
vous
verrez
ça
dautres
convives
étaient
arrivés
ne
pouvait
plus
remuer
dans
la
pièce
les
bruits
de
vaisselle
et
dargenterie
avaient
cessé
maintenant
une
querelle
venait
du
grand
salon
où
grondait
la
voix
furieuse
du
maître
dhôtel
nana
simpatientait
nattendant
plus
dinvités
sétonnant
quon
ne
servît
pas
elle
avait
envoyé
georges
demander
ce
qui
se
passait
lorsquelle
resta
très
surprise
de
voir
encore
entrer
du
monde
des
hommes
des
femmes
ceuxlà
elle
ne
les
connaissait
pas
du
tout
alors
un
peu
embarrassée
elle
interrogea
bordenave
mignon
labordette
ils
ne
les
connaissaient
pas
non
plus
quand
elle
sadressa
au
comte
de
vandeuvres
il
se
souvint
brusquement
cétaient
les
jeunes
gens
quil
avait
racolés
chez
le
comte
muffat
nana
le
remercia
très
bien
très
bien
seulement
serait
joliment
serré
et
elle
pria
labordette
daller
faire
ajouter
sept
couverts
peine
étaitil
sorti
que
le
valet
introduisit
de
nouveau
trois
personnes
non
cette
fois
ça
devenait
ridicule
ne
tiendrait
pas
pour
sûr
nana
qui
commençait
à
se
fâcher
disait
de
son
grand
air
que
ce
nétait
guère
convenable
mais
en
en
voyant
arriver
encore
deux
elle
se
mit
à
rire
elle
trouvait
ça
trop
drôle
tant
pis
tiendrait
comme
tiendrait
tous
étaient
debout
il
n
avait
que
gaga
et
rose
mignon
assises
bordenave
accaparant
à
lui
seul
deux
fauteuils
les
voix
bourdonnaient
parlait
bas
en
étouffant
de
légers
bâillements
dis
donc
fille
demanda
bordenave
si
se
mettait
à
table
tout
de
même
nous
sommes
au
complet
nestce
pas
ah
oui
par
exemple
nous
sommes
au
complet
réponditelle
en
riant
elle
promenait
ses
regards
mais
elle
devint
sérieuse
comme
étonnée
de
ne
pas
trouver
quelquun
là
sans
doute
il
manquait
un
convive
dont
elle
ne
parlait
point
il
fallait
attendre
quelques
minutes
plus
tard
les
invités
aperçurent
au
milieu
deux
un
grand
monsieur
à
figure
noble
et
à
belle
barbe
blanche
et
le
plus
surprenant
était
que
personne
ne
lavait
vu
entrer
il
devait
sêtre
glissé
dans
le
petit
salon
par
une
porte
de
la
chambre
à
coucher
restée
entrouverte
un
silence
régna
des
chuchotements
couraient
le
comte
de
vandeuvres
savait
certainement
qui
était
le
monsieur
car
ils
avaient
tous
deux
échangé
une
discrète
poignée
de
main
mais
il
répondit
par
un
sourire
aux
questions
des
femmes
alors
caroline
héquet
à
demivoix
paria
pour
un
lord
anglais
qui
retournait
le
lendemain
se
marier
à
londres
elle
le
connaissait
bien
elle
lavait
eu
et
cette
histoire
fit
le
tour
des
dames
seulement
maria
blond
prétendait
de
son
côté
reconnaître
un
ambassadeur
allemand
à
preuve
quil
couchait
souvent
avec
une
de
ses
amies
parmi
les
hommes
en
phrases
rapides
le
jugeait
une
tête
de
monsieur
sérieux
peutêtre
quil
payait
le
souper
probable
ça
sentait
ça
bah
pourvu
que
le
souper
fût
bon
enfin
resta
dans
le
doute
oubliait
déjà
le
vieillard
à
barbe
blanche
lorsque
le
maître
dhôtel
ouvrit
la
porte
du
grand
salon
madame
est
servie
nana
avait
accepté
le
bras
de
steiner
sans
paraître
remarquer
un
mouvement
du
vieillard
qui
se
mit
à
marcher
derrière
elle
tout
seul
dailleurs
le
défilé
ne
put
sorganiser
les
hommes
et
les
femmes
entrèrent
débandés
plaisantant
avec
une
bonhomie
bourgeoise
sur
ce
manque
de
cérémonie
une
longue
table
allait
dun
bout
à
lautre
de
la
vaste
pièce
vide
de
meubles
et
cette
table
se
trouvait
encore
trop
petite
car
les
assiettes
se
touchaient
quatre
candélabres
à
dix
bougies
éclairaient
le
couvert
un
surtout
en
plaqué
avec
des
gerbes
de
fleurs
à
droite
et
à
gauche
cétait
un
luxe
de
restaurant
de
la
porcelaine
à
filets
dorés
sans
chiffre
de
largenterie
usée
et
ternie
par
les
continuels
lavages
des
cristaux
dont
pouvait
compléter
les
douzaines
dépareillées
dans
tous
les
bazars
cela
sentait
une
crémaillère
pendue
trop
vite
au
milieu
dune
fortune
subite
et
lorsque
rien
nétait
encore
en
place
un
lustre
manquait
les
candélabres
dont
les
bougies
très
hautes
séméchaient
à
peine
faisaient
un
jour
pâle
et
jaune
audessus
des
compotiers
des
assiettes
montées
des
jattes
où
les
fruits
les
petits
fours
les
confitures
alternaient
symétriquement
vous
savez
dit
nana
se
place
comme
veut
cest
plus
amusant
elle
se
tenait
debout
au
milieu
de
la
table
le
vieux
monsieur
quon
ne
connaissait
pas
sétait
mis
à
sa
droite
pendant
quelle
gardait
steiner
à
sa
gauche
des
convives
sasseyaient
déjà
quand
des
jurons
partirent
du
petit
salon
cétait
bordenave
quon
oubliait
et
qui
avait
toutes
les
peines
du
monde
pour
se
relever
de
ses
deux
fauteuils
gueulant
appelant
cette
rosse
de
simonne
filée
avec
les
autres
les
femmes
coururent
pleines
dapitoiement
bordenave
apparut
soutenu
porté
par
caroline
clarisse
tatan
néné
maria
blond
et
ce
fut
toute
une
affaire
pour
linstaller
au
milieu
de
la
table
en
face
de
nana
criaiton
bordenave
au
milieu
il
nous
présidera
alors
ces
dames
lassirent
au
milieu
mais
il
fallut
une
seconde
chaise
pour
sa
jambe
deux
femmes
soulevèrent
sa
jambe
lallongèrent
délicatement
ça
ne
faisait
rien
il
mangerait
de
côté
cré
nom
de

grognaitil
eston
empoté
tout
de
même
ah
mes
petites
chattes
papa

recommande
à
vous
il
avait
rose
mignon
à
sa
droite
et
lucy
stewart
à
sa
gauche
elles
promirent
davoir
bien
soin
de
lui
tout
le
monde
maintenant
se
casait
le
comte
de
vandeuvres
se
plaça
entre
lucy
et
clarisse
fauchery
entre
rose
mignon
et
caroline
héquet
de
lautre
côté
hector
de
la
faloise
sétait
précipité
pour
se
mettre
près
de
gaga
malgré
les
appels
de
clarisse
en
face
tandis
que
mignon
qui
ne
lâchait
pas
steiner
nétait
séparé
de
lui
que
par
blanche
et
avait
à
gauche
tatan
néné
puis
venait
labordette
enfin
aux
deux
bouts
se
trouvaient
des
jeunes
gens
des
femmes
simonne
léa
de

maria
blond
sans
ordre
en
tas
cétait
là
que
daguenet
et
georges
hugon
sympathisaient
de
plus
en
plus
en
regardant
nana
avec
des
sourires
cependant
comme
deux
personnes
restaient
debout
plaisanta
les
hommes
offraient
leurs
genoux
clarisse
qui
ne
pouvait
remuer
les
coudes
disait
à
vandeuvres
quelle
comptait
sur
lui
pour
la
faire
manger
aussi
ce
bordenave
tenait
une
place
avec
ses
chaises
il
eut
un
dernier
effort
tout
le
monde

sasseoir
mais
par
exemple

trop
quant
à

il
se
rendait
insupportable
en

toujours
déplacés

complaisamment
les

humides
de
tendresse
paternelle
et
à
la
représentation
continuatil
ils
étaient
si
drôles
sérieux
comme
des
hommes
mangeant
rose
du
regard
demandant
pourquoi
maman
avait
comme
ça
les
jambes
nues
toute
la
table
se
mit
à

triomphait
flatté
dans
son
orgueil
de

cest
un
gaillard
puis
il
plaisanta
steiner
qui
naimait

et
il
lui
disait
dun
air
de
tranquille
audace
que
sil
était
père
il
gâcherait
moins
bêtement
sa
fortune
tout
en
parlant
il
guettait
le
banquier
pardessus

pour

faisait
avec

mais
depuis
quelques
minutes
rose

se
mettait
en

et
les

diamant
au

il
achevait
un
filet
de
chevreuil

des

du

il
portait
une
tunique
entièrement
couverte
de
pierreries
une
merveille
un
astre
flambant
qui
représentait
des
millions
et
ces
dames
pâles
les
yeux
luisants
de
convoitise
allongeaient
la
tête
citaient
les
autres
rois
les
autres
empereurs
quon

de
quelque
caprice
royal
dune
nuit
payée
dune

demanda
caroline
héquet
à
vandeuvres
en
se
penchant
quel
âge
lempereur
de
russie
oh
il
n
pas

répondit
le
comte
qui
riait
rien
à
faire
je
vous
en
préviens
nana
affecta
de
paraître
blessée
le
mot
semblait
trop
raide
protesta
par
un
murmure
mais
blanche
donnait
des
détails
sur
le
roi
ditalie
quelle
avait
vu
une
fois
à
milan
il
nétait
guère
beau
ce
qui
ne
lempêchait
pas
davoir
toutes
les
femmes
et
elle
resta
ennuyée
lorsque
fauchery
assura
que
victoremmanuel
ne
pourrait
venir
louise
violaine
et
léa
en
tenaient
pour
lempereur
dautriche
tout
dun
coup
entendit
la
petite
maria
blond
qui
disait
en
voilà
un
vieux
seccot
que
le
roi
de
prusse
jétais
à
bade
lannée

rencontrait
toujours
avec

un
homme
charmant
cest
ce
que
je
disais
hier
sécria
vandeuvres
ne
voulait
pas
croire
et
comme
chez
la
comtesse
sabine
soccupa
longuement
du
comte
de
bismarck
vandeuvres
répéta
les
mêmes
phrases
un
instant
fut
de
nouveau
dans
le
salon
des
muffat
seules
les
dames
étaient
changées
justement
passa
à
la
musique
puis
foucarmont
ayant
laissé
échapper
un
mot
de
la
prise
de
voile
dont
paris
causait
nana
intéressée
voulut
absolument
avoir
des
détails
sur
mademoiselle
de
fougeray
oh
la
pauvre
petite
senterrer
comme
ça
vivante
enfin
quand
la
vocation
avait
parlé
autour
de
la
table
les
femmes
étaient
très
touchées
et
georges
ennuyé
dentendre
ces
choses
une
seconde
fois
interrogeait
daguenet
sur
les
habitudes
intimes
de
nana
lorsque
la
conversation
revint
fatalement
au
comte
de
bismarck
tatan
néné
se
penchait
à
loreille
de
labordette
pour
demander
qui
était
ce
bismarck
quelle
ne
connaissait
pas
alors
labordette
froidement
lui
conta
des
histoires
énormes
ce
bismarck
mangeait
de
la
viande
crue
quand
il
rencontrait
une
femme
près
de
son
repaire
il
lemportait
sur
son

déjà
eu
de
cette
manière
trentedeux
enfants

de
rire
elle
comprit
quon

depuis

penchée
dans

incommode

marbrée
de

elle
navait
qu
à

jouant
avec

soufflant
des
rires
dans
son
oreille
velue
samusant
des
frissons
qui
passaient
sur
son

toujours

un

par

fâchait
en
criant
quon
laissait

dans

des

quon
buvait
depuis

à

dune
ivresse
nerveuse

par

en

penchait

de

bousculant

finis
tu
en
assez
ce
serait
drôle
sil

soigner
le
reste
de
la
nuit
une
griserie
mettait
aux
joues
de

les
flammes
rouges
des
poitrinaires
tandis
que
rose

se
faisait
tendre

étourdie
davoir
trop
mangé
riait
vaguement
à
sa
bêtise
les

parlaient
toutes
ensemble
racontant
leurs
affaires
une
dispute
avec
leur
cocher
un
projet
de
partie
à
la
campagne
des
histoires
compliquées
damants
volés
et
rendus
mais
un
jeune
homme
près
de
georges
ayant
voulu
embrasser
léa
de

reçut
une
tape
avec
un
dites
donc
vous
lâchezmoi
plein
dune
belle
indignation
et
georges
très
gris
très
excité
par
la
vue
de
nana
hésita
devant
une
idée
quil
mûrissait
gravement
celle
de
se
mettre
à
quatre
pattes
sous
la
table
et
daller
se
blottir
à
ses
pieds
ainsi
quun
petit
chien
personne
ne
laurait
vu
il
serait
resté
bien
sage
puis
sur
la
prière
de
léa
daguenet
ayant
dit
au
jeune
homme
de
se
tenir
tranquille
georges
tout
dun
coup
éprouva
un
gros
chagrin
comme
si
lon
venait
de
le
gronder
luimême
cétait
bête
cétait
triste
il
n
avait
plus
rien
de
bon
daguenet
pourtant
plaisantait
le
forçait
à
avaler
un
grand
verre
deau
en
lui
demandant
ce
quil
ferait
sil
se
trouvait
seul
avec
une
femme
puisque
trois
verres
de
champagne
le
flanquaient
par
terre
tenez
reprit
foucarmont
à
la
havane
ils
font
une
eaudevie
avec
une
baie
sauvage
croirait
avaler
du
feu
eh
bien
jen
ai
bu
un
soir
plus
dun
litre
ça
ne
rien
fait
plus
fort
que
ça
un
autre
jour
sur
les
côtes
de
coromandel
des
sauvages
nous
ont
donné
je
ne
sais
quel
mélange
de
poivre
et
de
vitriol
ça
ne
rien
fait
je
ne
peux
pas
griser
depuis
un
instant
la
figure
de
la
faloise
en
face
lui
déplaisait
il
ricanait
il
lançait
des
mots
désagréables
la
faloise
dont
la
tête
tournait
se
remuait
beaucoup
en
se
serrant
contre
gaga
mais
une
inquiétude
avait
achevé
de
lagiter
venait
de
lui
prendre
son
mouchoir
il
réclamait
son
mouchoir
avec
lentêtement
de
livresse
interrogeant
ses
voisins
se
baissant
pour
regarder
sous
les
sièges
et
sous
les
pieds
et
comme
gaga
tâchait
de
le
tranquilliser
cest
stupide
murmuratil
il
au
coin
mes
initiales
et
couronne
ça
peut
compromettre
dites
donc
monsieur
falamoise
lamafoise
mafaloise
cria
foucarmont
qui
trouva
très
spirituel
de
défigurer
ainsi
à
linfini
le
nom
du
jeune
homme
mais
la
faloise
se
fâcha
il
parla
de
ses
ancêtres
en
bégayant
il
menaça
denvoyer
une
carafe
à
la
tête
de
foucarmont
le
comte
de
vandeuvres
dut
intervenir
pour
lui
assurer
que
foucarmont
était
très
drôle
tout
le
monde
riait
en
effet
cela
ébranla
le
jeune
homme
ahuri
qui
voulut
bien
se
rasseoir
et
il
mangeait
avec
une
obéissance
denfant
lorsque
son
cousin
lui
ordonnait
de
manger
en
grossissant
la
voix
gaga
lavait
repris
contre
elle
seulement
de
temps
à
autre
il
jetait
sur
les
convives
des
regards
sournois
et
anxieux
cherchant
toujours
son
mouchoir
alors
foucarmont
en
veine
desprit
attaqua
labordette
à
travers
toute
la
table
louise
violaine
tâchait
de
le
faire
taire
parce
que
disaitelle
quand
il
était
comme
ça
taquin
avec
les
autres
ça
finissait
toujours
mal
pour
elle
il
avait
trouvé
une
plaisanterie
qui
consistait
à
appeler
labordette
madame
elle
devait
lamuser
beaucoup
il
la
répétait
tandis
que
labordette
tranquillement
haussait
les
épaules
en
disant
chaque
fois
taisezvous
donc
mon
cher
cest
bête
mais
comme
foucarmont
continuait
et
arrivait
aux
insultes
sans
quon
sût
pourquoi
il
cessa
de
lui
répondre
il
sadressa
au
comte
de
vandeuvres
monsieur
faites
taire
votre
ami
je
ne
veux
pas
fâcher
deux
reprises
il
sétait
battu
le
saluait
ladmettait
partout
ce
fut
un
soulèvement
général
contre
foucarmont
la
table
ségayait
le
trouvant
très
spirituel
mais
ce
nétait
pas
une
raison
pour
gâter
la
nuit
vandeuvres
dont
le
fin
visage
se
cuivrait
exigea
quil
rendît
son
sexe
à
labordette
les
autres
hommes
mignon
steiner
bordenave
très
lancés
intervinrent
aussi
criant
couvrant
sa
voix
et
seul
le
vieux
monsieur
quon
oubliait
près
de
nana
gardait
son
grand
air
son
sourire
las
et
muet
en
suivant
de
ses
yeux
pâles
cette
débâcle
du
dessert
mon
petit
chat
si
nous
prenions
le
café
ici
dit
bordenave
est
très
bien
nana
ne
répondit
pas
tout
de
suite
depuis
le
commencement
du
souper
elle
ne
semblait
plus
chez
elle
tout
ce
monde
lavait
noyée
et
étourdie
appelant
les
garçons
parlant
haut
se
mettant
à
laise
comme
si
lon
était
au
restaurant
ellemême
oubliait
son
rôle
de
maîtresse
de
maison
ne
soccupait
que
du
gros
steiner
qui
crevait
dapoplexie
à
son
côté
elle
lécoutait
refusant
encore
de
la
tête
avec
son
rire
provocant
de
blonde
grasse
le
champagne
quelle
avait
bu
la
faisait
toute
rose
la
bouche
humide
les
yeux
luisants
et
le
banquier
offrait
davantage
à
chaque
mouvement
câlin
de
ses
épaules
aux
légers
renflements
voluptueux
de
son
cou
lorsquelle
tournait
la
tête
il
voyait
là
près
de
loreille
un
petit
coin
délicat
un
satin
qui
le
rendait
fou
par
moments
nana
dérangée
se
rappelait
ses
convives
cherchant
à
être
aimable
pour
montrer
quelle
savait
recevoir
vers
la
fin
du
souper
elle
était
très
grise
ça
la
désolait
le
champagne
la
grisait
tout
de
suite
alors
une
idée
lexaspéra
cétait
une
saleté
que
ces
dames
voulaient
lui
faire
en
se
conduisant
mal
chez
elle
oh
elle
voyait
clair
lucy
avait
cligné
loeil
pour
pousser
foucarmont
contre
labordette
tandis
que
rose
caroline
et
les
autres
excitaient
ces
messieurs
maintenant
le
bousin
était
à
ne
pas
sentendre
histoire
de
dire
quon
pouvait
tout
se
permettre
quand
soupait
chez
nana
eh
bien
ils
allaient
voir
elle
avait
beau
être
grise
elle
était
encore
la
plus
chic
et
la
plus
comme
il
faut
mon
petit
chat
reprit
bordenave
dis
donc
de
servir
le
café
ici
jaime
mieux
ça
à
cause
de
jambe
mais
nana
sétait
levée
brutalement
en
murmurant
aux
oreilles
de
steiner
et
du
vieux
monsieur
stupéfaits
cest
bien
fait
ça
mapprendra
à
inviter
du
sale
monde
puis
elle
indiqua
du
geste
la
porte
de
la
salle
à
manger
et
ajouta
tout
haut
vous
savez
si
vous
voulez
du
café
il
en
là
quitta
la
table
se
poussa
vers
la
salle
à
manger
sans
remarquer
la
colère
de
nana
et
il
ne
resta
bientôt
plus
dans
le
salon
que
bordenave
se
tenant
aux
murs
avançant
avec
précaution
pestant
contre
ces
sacrées
femmes
qui
se
fichaient
de
papa
maintenant
quelles
étaient
pleines
derrière
lui
les
garçons
enlevaient
déjà
le
couvert
sous
les
ordres
du
maître
dhôtel
lancés
à
voix
haute
ils
se
précipitaient
se
bousculaient
faisant
disparaître
la
table
comme
un
décor
de
féerie
au
coup
de
sifflet
du
maître
machiniste
ces
dames
et
ces
messieurs
devaient
revenir
au
salon
après
avoir
pris
le
café
fichtre
il
fait
moins
chaud
ici
dit
gaga
avec
un
léger
frisson
en
entrant
dans
la
salle
à
manger
la
fenêtre
de
cette
pièce
était
restée
ouverte
deux
lampes
éclairaient
la
table
où
le
café
se
trouvait
servi
avec
des
liqueurs
il
n
avait
pas
de
chaises
le
café
debout
pendant
que
le
brouhaha
des
garçons
à
côté
augmentait
encore
nana
avait
disparu
mais
personne
ne
sinquiétait
de
son
absence
se
passait
parfaitement
delle
chacun
se
servant
fouillant
dans
les
tiroirs
du
buffet
pour
chercher
des
petites
cuillers
qui
manquaient
plusieurs
groupes
sétaient
formés
les
personnes
séparées
durant
le
souper
se
rapprochaient
et
lon
échangeait
des
regards
des
rires
significatifs
des
mots
qui
résumaient
les
situations
nestce
pas
auguste
dit
rose

seconde
le

folle
en
bon
administrateur
il
mettrait
ordre
à
ce
gaspillage
pour
un
article
soit
mais
ensuite
porte
close
cependant
comme
il
connaissait
la
mauvaise
tête
de
sa
femme
et
quil
avait
pour
règle
de
lui
permettre
paternellement
une
bêtise
lorsquil
le
fallait
il
répondit
en
se
faisant
aimable
certainement

très
heureux

café
à
petites
gorgées
elle
regardait
steiner
fixement
très
pâle
et
toute
la
colère
contenue
de
son
abandon
passa
dans
ses
yeux
comme
une
flamme
elle
voyait
plus
clair
que

il
voulut
plaisanter
elle
séloigna
dun
air
de
reine
clarisse
qui
sétait
adossée
contre
un
mur
afin
de
boire
tranquillement
un
verre
de
kirsch

en
voilà
des

cependant
foucarmont
sattaquait
aux
liqueurs
il
continuait
de
ricaner
en
regardant
labordette
qui
buvait
son
café
au
milieu
de
ces
dames
et
il
lâchait
des
bouts
de
phrase
le
fils
dun
marchand
de
chevaux
dautres
disaient
le
bâtard
dune
comtesse
aucun
revenu
et
toujours
vingtcinq

dans

le
domestique
des

un
gaillard

le
dérangeait
aucunement
pas
ça
disaitil
et
il
faisait
claquer
longle
de
son
pouce
au
bord
de
ses
dents
mais
tout
dun
coup
au
moment
où
il
savançait
sur
labordette
il
devint
blême
et
sabattit
devant
le
buffet
comme
une
masse
il
était
ivre
mort
louise
violaine
se
désola
elle
le
disait
bien
que
ça
finirait
mal
maintenant
elle
en
avait
pour
le
reste
de
sa
nuit
à
le
soigner
gaga
la
rassurait
examinant
lofficier
dun
oeil
de
femme
expérimentée
déclarant
que
ce
ne

monsieur

dormir
comme

à
quinze
heures
sans

foucarmont
tiens

envolée
en
quittant
la
table

souvenait
delle
tout
le
monde
la
réclamait
steiner
inquiet
depuis
un
instant
questionna
vandeuvres
au
sujet
du
vieux
monsieur
disparu
lui
aussi
mais
le
comte
le
rassura
il
venait
de
reconduire
le
vieillard
un
personnage
étranger
dont
il
était
inutile
de
dire
le
nom
un
homme
très
riche
qui
se
contentait
de
payer
les
soupers
puis
comme
oubliait
de
nouveau
nana
vandeuvres
aperçut
daguenet
la
tête
à
une
porte
lappelant
dun
signe
et
dans
la
chambre
à
coucher
il
trouva
la
maîtresse
de
la
maison
assise
raidie
les
lèvres
blanches
tandis
que
daguenet
et
georges
debout
la
regardaient
dun
air
consterné
quavezvous
donc
demandatil
surpris
elle
ne
répondit
pas
elle
ne
tourna
pas
la
tête
il
répéta
sa
question
jai
criatelle
enfin
que
je
ne
veux
pas
quon
se
foute
de
moi
alors
elle
lâcha
ce
qui
lui
vint
à
la
bouche
oui
oui
elle
nétait
pas
une
bête
elle
voyait
clair
sétait
fichu
delle
pendant
le
souper
avait
dit
des
horreurs
pour
montrer
quon
la
méprisait
un
tas
de
salopes
qui
ne
lui
allaient
pas
à
la
cheville
plus
souvent
quelle
se
donnerait
encore
du
tintouin
histoire
de
se
faire
bêcher
ensuite
elle
ne
savait
pas
ce
qui
la
retenait
de
flanquer
tout
ce
sale
monde
à
la
porte
et
la
rage
létranglant
sa
voix
se
brisa
dans
des
sanglots
voyons
fille
tu
es
grise
dit
vandeuvres
qui
se
mit
à
la
tutoyer
il
faut
être
raisonnable
non
elle
refusait
davance
elle
resterait
là
je
suis
grise
cest
possible
mais
je
veux
quon
respecte
depuis
un
quart
dheure
daguenet
et
georges
la
suppliaient
vainement
de
revenir
dans
la
salle
à
manger
elle
sentêtait
ses
invités
pouvaient
bien
faire
ce
quils
voudraient
elle
les
méprisait
trop
pour
retourner
avec
eux
jamais
jamais
laurait
coupée
en
morceaux
quelle
serait
restée
dans
sa
chambre
jaurais
dû
méfier
repritelle
cest
ce
chameau
de
rose
qui
monté
le
complot
ainsi
cette
femme
honnête
que
jattendais
ce
soir
bien
sûr
rose
laura
empêchée
elle
parlait
de
madame
robert
vandeuvres
lui
donna
sa
parole
dhonneur
que
madame
robert
avait
refusé
dellemême
il
écoutait
et
discutait
sans
rire
habitué
à
de
pareilles
scènes
sachant
comment
il
fallait
prendre
les
femmes
quand
elles
se
trouvaient
dans
cet
état
mais
dès
quil
cherchait
à
lui
saisir
les
mains
pour
la
lever
de
sa
chaise
et
lentraîner
elle
se
débattait
avec
un
redoublement
de
colère
par
exemple
ne
lui
ferait
jamais
croire
que
fauchery
navait
pas
détourné
le
comte
muffat
de
venir
un
vrai
serpent
ce
fauchery
un
envieux
un
homme
capable
de
sacharner
après
une
femme
et
de
détruire
son
bonheur
car
enfin
elle
le
savait
le
comte
sétait
pris
dun
béguin
pour
elle
elle
aurait
pu
lavoir
lui
chère
jamais
sécria
vandeuvres
soubliant
et
riant
pourquoi
donc
demandatelle
sérieuse
un
peu
dégrisée
parce
quil
donne
dans
les
curés
et
que
sil
vous
touchait
du
bout
des
doigts
il
irait
sen
confesser
le
lendemain
écoutez
un
bon
conseil
ne
laissez
pas
échapper
lautre
un
instant
elle
resta
silencieuse
réfléchissant
puis
elle
se
leva
alla
se
baigner
les
yeux
pourtant
lorsquon
voulait
lemmener
dans
la
salle
à
manger
elle
criait
toujours
non
furieusement
vandeuvres
quitta
la
chambre
avec
un
sourire
sans
insister
davantage
et
dès
quil
ne
fut
plus
là
elle
eut
une
crise
dattendrissement
se
jetant
dans
les
bras
de
daguenet
répétant
ah
mon
mimi
il
n
que
toi
je
taime
va
je
taime
bien
ce
serait
trop
bon
si
lon
pouvait
vivre
toujours
ensemble
mon
dieu
que
les
femmes
sont
malheureuses
puis
apercevant
georges
qui
devenait
très
rouge
à
les
voir
sembrasser
elle
lembrassa
également
mimi
ne
pouvait
être
jaloux
dun
bébé
elle
voulait
que
paul
et
georges
fussent
toujours
daccord
parce
que
ce
serait
si
gentil
de
rester
comme
ça
tous
les
trois
en
sachant
quon
saimait
bien
mais
un
bruit
singulier
les
dérangea
quelquun
ronflait
dans
la
chambre
alors
ayant
cherché
ils
aperçurent
bordenave
qui
après
avoir
pris
son
café
devait
sêtre
installé
là
commodément
il
dormait
sur
deux
chaises
la
tête
appuyée
au
bord
du
lit
la
jambe
allongée
nana
le
trouva
si
drôle
la
bouche
ouverte
le
nez
remuant
à
chaque
ronflement
quelle
fut
secouée
dun
fou
rire
elle
sortit
de
la
chambre
suivie
de
daguenet
et
de
georges
traversa
la
salle
à
manger
entra
dans
le
salon
riant
de
plus
en
plus
fort
oh
chère
ditelle
en
se
jetant
presque
dans
les
bras
de
rose
vous
navez
pas
idée
venez
voir
ça
toutes
les
femmes
durent
laccompagner
elle
leur
prenait
les
mains
avec
des
caresses
les
emmenait
de
force
dans
un
élan
de
gaieté
si
franc
que
toutes
riaient
déjà
de
confiance
la
bande
disparut
puis
revint
après
être
restée
une
minute
lhaleine
suspendue
autour
de
bordenave
étalé
magistralement
et
les
rires
éclatèrent
quand
une
delles
commandait
le
silence
entendait
au
loin
les
ronflements
de
bordenave
il
était
près
de
quatre
heures
dans
la
salle
à
manger
venait
de
dresser
une
table
de
jeu
où
sétaient
assis
vandeuvres
steiner
mignon
et
labordette
debout
derrière
eux
lucy
et
caroline
pariaient
tandis
que
blanche
ensommeillée
mécontente
de
sa
nuit
demandait
toutes
les
cinq
minutes
à
vandeuvres
sils
nallaient
pas
bientôt
partir
dans
le
salon
essayait
de
danser
daguenet
était
au
piano
à
la
commode
comme
disait
nana
elle
ne
voulait
pas
de
tapeur
mimi
jouait
des
valses
et
des
polkas
tant
quon
en
demandait
mais
la
danse
languissait
ces
dames
causaient
entre
elles
assoupies
au
fond
des
canapés
tout
à
coup
il
eut
un
vacarme
onze
jeunes
gens
qui
arrivaient
en
bande
riaient
très
haut
dans
lantichambre
se
poussaient
à
la
porte
du
salon
ils
sortaient
du
bal
du
ministère
de
lintérieur
en
habit
et
en
cravate
blanche
avec
des
brochettes
de
croix
inconnues
nana
fâchée
de
cette
entrée
tapageuse
appela
les
garçons
restés
dans
la
cuisine
en
leur
ordonnant
de
jeter
ces
messieurs
dehors
et
elle
jurait
quelle
ne
les
avait
jamais
vus
fauchery
labordette
daguenet
tous
les
hommes
sétaient
avancés
pour
faire
respecter
la
maîtresse
de
la
maison
de
gros
mots
volaient
des
bras
sallongeaient
un
instant
put
craindre
un
échange
général
de
claques
pourtant
un
petit
blond
lair
maladif
répétait
avec
insistance
voyons
nana
lautre
soir
chez
peters
dans
le
grand
salon
rouge
rappelezvous
donc
vous
nous
avez
invités
lautre
soir
chez
peters
elle
ne
se
souvenait
pas
du
tout
quel
soir
dabord
et
quand
le
petit
blond
lui
eut
dit
le
jour
le
mercredi
elle
se
rappela
bien
avoir
soupé
chez
peters
le
mercredi
mais
elle
navait
invité
personne
elle
en
était
à
peu
près
sûre
cependant
fille
si
tu
les
invités
murmura
labordette
qui
commençait
à
être
pris
de
doute
tu
étais
peutêtre
un
peu
gaie
alors
nana
se
mit
à
rire
cétait
possible
elle
ne
savait
plus
enfin
puisque
ces
messieurs
étaient
là
ils
pouvaient
entrer
tout
sarrangea
plusieurs
des
nouveaux
venus
retrouvaient
des
amis
dans
le
salon
lesclandre
finissait
par
des
poignées
de
main
le
petit
blond
à
lair
maladif
portait
un
des
grands
noms
de
france
dailleurs
ils
annoncèrent
que
dautres
devaient
les
suivre
et
en
effet
à
chaque
instant
la
porte
souvrait
des
hommes
se
présentaient
gantés
de
blanc
dans
une
tenue
officielle
cétait
toujours
la
sortie
du
bal
du
ministère
fauchery
demanda
en
plaisantant
si
le
ministre
nallait
pas
venir
mais
nana
vexée
répondit
que
le
ministre
allait
chez
des
gens
qui
ne
la
valaient
certainement
pas
ce
quelle
ne
disait
point
cétait
une
espérance
dont
elle
était
prise
celle
de
voir
entrer
le
comte
muffat
parmi
cette
queue
de
monde
il
pouvait
sêtre
ravisé
tout
en
causant
avec
rose
elle
guettait
la
porte
cinq
heures
sonnèrent
ne
dansait
plus
les
joueurs
seuls
sentêtaient
labordette
avait
cédé
sa
place
les
femmes
étaient
revenues
dans
le
salon
une
somnolence
de
veille
prolongée
alourdissait
sous
la
lumière
trouble
des
lampes
dont
les
mèches
charbonnées
rougissaient
les
globes
ces
dames
en
étaient
à
lheure
de
mélancolie
vague
où
elles
éprouvaient
le
besoin
de
raconter
leur
histoire
blanche
de
sivry
parlait
de
son
grandpère
le
général
tandis
que
clarisse
inventait
un
roman
un
duc
qui
lavait
séduite
chez
son
oncle
où
il
venait
chasser
le
sanglier
et
toutes
deux
le
dos
tourné
haussaient
les
épaules
en
demandant
sil
était
dieu
possible
de
conter
des
blagues
pareilles
quant
à
lucy
stewart
elle
avouait
tranquillement
son
origine
elle
parlait
volontiers
de
sa
jeunesse
lorsque
son
père
le
graisseur
du
chemin
de
fer
du
nord
la
régalait
le
dimanche
dun
chausson
aux
pommes
oh
que
je
vous
dise
cria
brusquement
la
petite
maria
blond
il
en
face
de
chez
moi
un
monsieur
un
russe
enfin
un
homme
excessivement
riche
voilà
quhier
je
reçois
un
panier
de
fruits
mais
un
panier
de
fruits
des
pêches
énormes
des
raisins
gros
comme
ça
enfin
quelque
chose
dextraordinaire
dans
cette
saison
et
au
milieu
six
billets
de
mille
cétait
le
russe
naturellement
jai
tout
renvoyé
mais
ça
fait
un
peu
mal
au
coeur
pour
les
fruits
ces
dames
se
regardèrent
en
pinçant
les
lèvres
son
âge
la
petite
maria
blond
avait
un
joli
toupet
avec
ça
que
de
pareilles
histoires
arrivaient
à
des
traînées
de
son
espèce
cétaient
entre
elles
des
mépris
profonds
elles
jalousaient
surtout
lucy
furieuses
de
ses
trois
princes
depuis
que
lucy
chaque
matin
faisait
à
cheval
une
promenade
au
bois
ce
qui
lavait
lancée
toutes
montaient
à
cheval
une
rage
les
tenait
le
jour
allait
paraître
nana
détourna
les
yeux
de
la
porte
perdant
espoir
sennuyait
à
crever
rose
mignon
avait
refusé
de
chanter
la
pantoufle
pelotonnée
sur
un
canapé
où
elle
causait
bas
avec
fauchery
en
attendant
mignon
qui
gagnait
déjà
une
cinquantaine
de
louis
à
vandeuvres
un
monsieur
gras
décoré
et
de
mine
sérieuse
venait
bien
de
réciter
le
sacrifice
dabraham
en
patois
dalsace
quand
dieu
jure
il
dit
sacré
nom
de
moi
et
isaac
répond
toujours
oui
papa
seulement
personne
nayant
compris
le
morceau
avait
paru
stupide
ne
savait
que
faire
pour
être
gai
pour
finir
follement
la
nuit
un
instant
labordette
imagina
de
dénoncer
les
femmes
à
loreille
de
la
faloise
qui
allait
rôder
autour
de
chacune
regardant
si
elle
navait
pas
son
mouchoir
dans
le
cou
puis
comme
des
bouteilles
de
champagne
restaient
sur
le
buffet
les
jeunes
gens
sétaient
remis
à
boire
ils
sappelaient
sexcitaient
mais
une
ivresse
morne
dune
bêtise
à
pleurer
envahissait
le
salon
invinciblement
alors
le
petit
blondin
celui
qui
portait
un
des
grands
noms
de
france
à
bout
dinvention
désespéré
de
ne
rien
trouver
de
drôle
eut
une
idée
il
emporta
sa
bouteille
de
champagne
et
acheva
de
la
vider
dans
le
piano
tous
les
autres
se
tordirent
tiens
demanda
avec
étonnement
tatan
néné
qui
lavait
aperçu
pourquoi
donc
metil
du
champagne
dans
le
piano
comment
fille
tu
ne
sais
pas
ça
répondit
labordette
gravement
il
n
rien
de
bon
comme
le
champagne
pour
les
pianos
ça
leur
donne
du
son
ah
murmura
tatan
néné
convaincue
et
comme
riait
elle
se
fâcha
estce
quelle
savait
lembrouillait
toujours
ça
se
gâtait
décidément
la
nuit
menaçait
de
finir
dune
façon
malpropre
dans
un
coin
maria
blond
sétait
empoignée
avec
léa
de
horn
quelle
accusait
de
coucher
avec
des
gens
pas
assez
riches
et
elles
en
venaient
aux
gros
mots
en
sattrapant
sur
leurs
figures
lucy
qui
était
laide
les
fit
taire
ça
ne
signifiait
rien
la
figure
il
fallait
être
bien
faite
plus
loin
sur
un
canapé
un
attaché
dambassade
avait
passé
un
bras
à
la
taille
de
simonne
quil
tâchait
de
baiser
au
cou
mais
simonne
éreintée
maussade
le
repoussait
chaque
fois
avec
des
tu
membêtes
et
de
grands
coups
déventail
sur
la
figure
aucune
dailleurs
ne
voulait
quon
la
touchât
estce
quon
les
prenait
pour
des
filles
cependant
gaga
qui
avait
rattrapé
la
faloise
le
tenait
presque
sur
ses
genoux
tandis
que
clarisse
entre
deux
messieurs
disparaissait
secouée
dun
rire
nerveux
de
femme
quon
chatouille
autour
du
piano
le
petit
jeu
continuait
dans
un
coup
de
folie
bête
se
poussait
chacun
voulait
verser
son
fond
de
bouteille
cétait
simple
et
gentil
tiens
mon
vieux
bois
un
coup
diantre
il
soif
ce
piano
attention
en
voici
encore
une
il
ne
faut
rien
perdre
nana
le
dos
tourné
ne
les
voyait
pas
elle
se
rabattait
décidément
sur
le
gros
steiner
assis
près
delle
tant
pis
cétait
la
faute
de
ce
muffat
qui
navait
pas
voulu
dans
sa
robe
de
foulard
blanc
légère
et
chiffonnée
comme
une
chemise
avec
sa
pointe
divresse
qui
la
pâlissait
les
yeux
battus
elle
soffrait
de
son
air
tranquille
de
bonne
fille
les
roses
de
son
chignon
et
de
son
corsage
sétaient
effeuillées
il
ne
restait
que
les
queues
mais
steiner
retira
vivement
la
main
de
ses
jupes
où
il
venait
de
rencontrer
les
épingles
mises
par
georges
quelques
gouttes
de
sang
parurent
une
tomba
sur
la
robe
et
la
tacha
maintenant
cest
signé
dit
nana
sérieusement
le
jour
grandissait
une
lueur
louche
dune
affreuse
tristesse
entrait
par
les
fenêtres
alors
le
départ
commença
une
débandade
pleine
de
malaise
et
daigreur
caroline
héquet
fâchée
davoir
perdu
sa
nuit

coupé
sur

couloir
des

elle
sétudiait
et
se
passait
un
doigt
sous
les
yeux
pour
corriger
son
maquillage
tandis
que
des
becs
de
gaz
aux
deux
côtés
de
la

chauffaient
dun
coup
de

un
feu
de

lhorloge
et
le
baromètre
à

et
à

que
des
sphinx
dorés
de
style
empire
accompagnaient
puis
il
sallongea
dans
un
vaste
fauteuil
à
oreillettes
dont
le
velours
vert
usé
par
quatre
générations
de
comédiens
avait
pris
des
tons
jaunes
et
il
resta
là
immobile
les
yeux
vagues
dans
lattitude
lasse
et
résignée
des
artistes
habitués
aux
attentes
de
leur
entrée
en
scène
le
vieux
bosc
venait
de
paraître
à
son
tour
traînant
les
pieds
toussant
enveloppé
dun
ancien
carrick
jaune
dont
un
pan
glissé
dune
épaule
laissait
voir
la
casaque
lamée
dor
du
roi
dagobert
un
instant
après
avoir
posé
sa
couronne
sur
le
piano
sans

une
parole

piétina

lair
brave
homme
pourtant
avec
ses
mains
quun
commencement
dalcoolisme
agitait
tandis
quune
longue
barbe
blanche
donnait
un
aspect
vénérable
à
sa
face
enflammée
divrogne
puis
dans
le
silence
comme
une
giboulée
fouettait
les
vitres
de
la
grande
fenêtre
carrée
qui
souvrait
sur
la
cour
il
eut
un
geste
dégoûté
quel
cochon
de

des

de
ses

il
eut
un
éclat
de
voix

dans
son
costume
du

en

comme
attirée
par
son
grand
nez
et
sa
bouche
largement
fendue
de
comique

et
quand
la
sonnette
eut

un
cri

perdit
dans
les
couloirs
en

pour
le

en

pour

ce
cri
se
rapprochait
un
petit
homme
blafard
passa
devant
les
portes
du
foyer
où
il
jeta
de
toute
la
puissance
de
sa
voix
grêle
en

pour
le
deux

du

dit
prullière
sans

avoir

ta
place

le
ferais
venir
du
café
déclara
lentement
le
vieux
bosc
qui
sétait
assis
sur
une
banquette
de
velours
vert
la
tête
appuyée
au
mur
mais
simonne
disait
quil
fallait
respecter
les
petits
bénéfices
de
madame
bron
elle
tapait
des
mains
allumée
mangeant
du
regard
fontan
dont
le
masque
en
museau
de
chèvre
remuait
dans
un
jeu
continuel
des
yeux
du
nez
et
de
la
bouche
oh

il
n
que

les
deux
portes
du
foyer
restaient
grandes
ouvertes
sur
le
corridor
menant
aux
coulisses
le
long
du
mur
jaune
vivement
éclairé
par
une
lanterne
à
gaz
quon
ne
voyait
pas
des
silhouettes
rapides
filaient
des
hommes
costumés
des
femmes
à

nues
enveloppées
dans
des
châles
toute
la
figuration
du
second
acte
les
chienlits
du
bastringue
de
la
boulenoire
et
lon
entendait
au
bout
du
corridor
la
dégringolade
des
pieds
tapant
les
cinq
marches
de
bois
qui
descendaient
sur
la
scène
comme
la
grande
clarisse
passait
en
courant
simonne
lappela
mais
elle
répondit
quelle
revenait
tout
de
suite
et
elle
reparut
presque
aussitôt
en
effet
grelottante
sous
la
mince
tunique
et
lécharpe

sapristi
ditelle

ne

chaud
et
moi
qui

dans

debout
devant
la
cheminée
grillant
ses
jambes
dont
le
maillot
se
moirait
de
rose
vif
elle
reprit
le
prince

les
autres
curieusement

chance
cette
nana

pariais
quil

viendrait
plus
simonne
ouvrait
la
bouche
mais
ses
paroles
furent
couvertes
par
un
nouveau
cri
qui
éclata
près
du
foyer
la
voix
aiguë
de
lavertisseur
lançait
dans
le
couloir
à
toute
volée
cest
frappé
ça
commence
à
être

murmura
méchamment
prullière
en
se
levant
pour
jeter
dans
la
glace
un
coup
doeil
de
bel
homme
adoré
des
loges
cest
frappé
cest
frappé
répétait
la
voix
de
plus
en
plus
perdue
de
lavertisseur
courant
les
étages
et
les
corridors
alors
fontan
qui
savait
comment
ça
sétait
passé
la
première
fois
entre
le
prince
et
nana
raconta
lhistoire
aux
deux
femmes
serrées
contre
lui
riant
très
haut
quand
il
se
baissait
pour
donner
certains
détails
le
vieux
bosc
navait
pas
remué
plein
dindifférence
ces
machineslà
ne
lintéressaient
plus
il
caressait
un
gros
chat
rouge
couché
en
rond
sur
la
banquette
béatement
et
il
finit
par
le
prendre
entre
ses
bras
avec
la
bonhomie
tendre
dun
roi
gâteux
le
chat
faisait
le
gros
dos
puis
après
avoir
flairé
longuement
la
grande
barbe
blanche
répugné
sans
doute
par
lodeur
de
colle
il
retourna
dormir
en
rond
sur
la
banquette
bosc
restait
grave
et
absorbé
ça
ne
fait
rien
moi
à
ta
place
je
prendrais
le
champagne
au
café
il
est
meilleur
ditil
tout
dun
coup
à
fontan
comme
celuici
finissait
son
histoire
cest
commencé
jeta
la
voix
longue
et
déchirée
de
lavertisseur
cest
commencé
cest
commencé
le
cri
roula
un
instant
un
bruit
de
pas
rapides
avait
couru
par
la
porte
du
couloir
brusquement
ouverte
il
vint
une
bouffée
de
musique
une
lointaine
rumeur
et
la
porte
retomba
entendit
le
coup
sourd
du
battant
rembourré
de
nouveau
une
paix
lourde
régnait
dans
le
foyer
des
artistes
comme
à
cent
lieues
de
cette
salle
où
toute
une
foule
applaudissait
simonne
et
clarisse
en
étaient
toujours
sur
nana
en
voilà
une
qui
ne
se
pressait
guère
la
veille
encore

avait
manqué
son
entrée
mais
tous
se
turent
une
grande
fille

dallonger
la
tête
puis
voyant
quelle

trompait

filé
au
fond
du
couloir

satin
avec
un
chapeau
et
une
voilette
prenant
des
airs
de

en

une
jolie
roulure

prullière
qui
la
rencontrait
depuis

au
café
des

et
simonne
conta
comment

des
poignées
de

les

se
posa
au

daplomb
sur

mignon
qui
abattit
ses
mains
énormes
sur
les
épaules
grêles
du
journaliste
dont
la
taille
plia
prullière
et
clarisse
retinrent
un
éclat
de
rire
depuis
quelque
temps

dune
comédie
qui
se
jouait
dans
les
coulisses
mignon
furieux
du
caprice
de
sa
femme
vexé
de
voir
ce
fauchery
napporter
au
ménage
quune
publicité
discutable

imaginé
de
se
venger
en
le
comblant
de
marques
damitié
chaque
soir
quand
il
le
rencontrait
sur
la
scène
il
le
bourrait
de
coups
comme
emporté
par
un
excès
de
tendresse
et
fauchery
chétif
à
côté
de
ce
colosse

accepter
les
tapes
en
souriant
dun
air
contraint
pour
ne

fâcher
avec
le
mari
de

mignon
poussant
la
farce
en

et

dans
la
poitrine
il
sétait
fendu

avait
porté
une
telle
botte
au
jeune

et
se
haussant
les
bras
nus
dans
son
costume
de

présenta
le

avec
une
moue
de
câlinerie
enfantine

ses
dédommagements

même
pas

ce
baiser

sa
femme
au
théâtre
mais
il
eut
un
rire
en
jetant
un
mince
coup

sur

avec
un
énorme
bouquet
entre

du
menton
la
loge
de

au
fond
du
couloir
cette
nana
la
couvrait
de
fleurs
puis
comme
madame
bron
revenait
elle
remit
une
lettre
à
clarisse
qui
laissa
échapper
un
juron
étouffé
encore
ce
raseur
de
la
faloise
en
voilà
un
homme
qui

avec
un
grand
bruit
de

et
lorsque
la
porte
du
couloir
fut
retombée
sourdement
entendit
dans
le
silence
du
foyer
une
nouvelle
giboulée
qui
battait
la
fenêtre
barillot
un
petit
vieillard
blême
garçon
de
théâtre
depuis
trente
ans
sétait
familièrement
approché
de
mignon
en
présentant
sa
tabatière
ouverte
cette
prise
offerte
et
acceptée
lui
donnait
une
minute
de
repos
dans
ses
continuelles
courses
à
travers
lescalier
et
les
couloirs
des
loges
il
avait
bien
encore
madame

la
nommait

à

tête
et
se
fichait
des

quand

voulait
manquer

la
manquait

sarrêta
étonné
murmurant

voici
elle

savoir
que
le
prince
est
arrivé
nana
en
effet
parut
dans
le
corridor
vêtue
en
poissarde
les
bras
et
le
visage
blancs
avec
deux
plaques
roses
sous
les
yeux
elle
nentra
pas
elle
envoya
simplement
un
signe
de
tête
à
mignon
et
à
fauchery
bonjour
ça
va
bien
mignon
seul
serra
la
main
quelle
tendait
et
nana
continua
son
chemin
royalement
suivie
par
son
habilleuse
qui
tout
en
lui
marchant
sur
les
talons
se
penchait
pour
arranger
les
plis
de
sa
jupe
puis
derrière
lhabilleuse
fermant
le
cortège
venait
satin
tâchant
davoir
un
air
comme
il
faut
et
sennuyant
déjà
à
crever
et
steiner
demanda
brusquement
mignon
monsieur
steiner

parti
hier
pour
le
loiret
dit
barillot
qui
retournait
sur
la
scène
je
crois
quil
va
acheter
làbas
une
campagne
ah
oui
je
sais
la
campagne
de
nana
mignon
était
devenu
grave
ce
steiner
qui
avait
promis
un
hôtel
à
rose
autrefois
enfin
il
fallait
ne
se
fâcher
avec
personne
cétait
une
occasion
à
retrouver
pris
de
rêverie
mais
supérieur
toujours
mignon
se
promenait
de
la
cheminée
à
la
console
il
n
avait
plus
que
lui
et
fauchery
dans
le
foyer
le
journaliste
fatigué
venait
de
sallonger
au
fond
du
grand
fauteuil
et
il
restait
bien
tranquille
les
paupières
demicloses
sous
les
regards
que
lautre
jetait
en
passant
quand
ils
étaient
seuls
mignon
dédaignait
de
le
bourrer
de
tapes
à
quoi
bon
puisque
personne
naurait
joui
de
la
scène
il
se
désintéressait
trop
pour
samuser
luimême
à
ses
farces
de
mari
goguenard
fauchery
heureux
de
ce
répit
de
quelques
minutes
allongeait
languissamment
les
pieds
devant
le
feu
les
yeux
en
lair
voyageant
du
baromètre
à
la
pendule
dans
sa
marche
mignon
se
planta
en
face
du
buste
de
potier
le
regarda
sans
le
voir
puis
retourna
devant
la
fenêtre
où
le
trou
sombre
de
la
cour
se
creusait
la
pluie
avait
cessé
un
silence
profond
sétait
fait
alourdi
encore
par
la
grosse
chaleur
du
coke
et
le
flamboiement
des
becs
de
gaz
plus
un
bruit
ne
montait
des
coulisses
lescalier
et
les
couloirs
semblaient
morts
cétait
une
de
ces
paix
étouffées
de
fin
dacte
lorsque
toute
la
troupe
enlève
sur
la
scène
le
vacarme
assourdissant
de
quelque
finale
tandis
que
le
foyer
vide
sendort
dans
un
bourdonnement
dasphyxie
ah
les
chameaux
sécria
tout
à
coup
la
voix
enrouée
de
bordenave
il
arrivait
seulement
et
il
gueulait
déjà
contre
deux
figurantes
qui
avaient
failli
sétaler
en
scène
parce
quelles
faisaient
les
imbéciles
quand
il
aperçut
mignon
et
fauchery
il
les
appela
pour
leur
montrer
quelque
chose
le
prince
venait
de
demander
à
complimenter
nana
dans
sa
loge
pendant
lentracte
mais
comme
il
les
emmenait
sur
le
théâtre
le
régisseur
passa
collez
donc
une
amende
à
ces
rosses
de
fernande
et
de
maria
dit
furieusement
bordenave
puis
se
calmant
tâchant
dattraper
une
dignité
de
père
noble
après
sêtre
passé
son
mouchoir
sur
la
face
il
ajouta
je
vais
recevoir
son
altesse
la
toile
tombait
au
milieu
dune
salve
prolongée
dapplaudissements
aussitôt
il
eut
une
débandade
dans
la
demiobscurité
de
la
scène
que
la
rampe
néclairait
plus
les
acteurs
et
les
figurants
se
hâtaient
de
regagner
leurs
loges
tandis
que
les
machinistes
enlevaient
rapidement
le
décor
cependant
simonne
et
clarisse
étaient
restées
au
fond
causant
à
voix
basse
en
scène
entre
deux
de
leurs
répliques
elles
venaient
darranger
une
affaire
clarisse
tout
bien
examiné
préférait
ne
pas
voir
la
faloise
qui
ne
se
décidait
plus
à
la
lâcher
pour
se
mettre
avec
gaga
simonne
irait
simplement
lui
expliquer
quon
ne
se
collait
pas
à
une
femme
de
cette
façon
enfin
elle
lexécuterait
alors
simonne
en
blanchisseuse
dopéracomique
les
épaules
couvertes
de
sa
fourrure
descendit
létroit
escalier
tournant
aux
marches
grasses
aux
murailles
humides
qui
menait
à
la
loge
de
la
concierge
cette
loge
placée
entre
lescalier
des
artistes
et
lescalier
de
ladministration
fermée
à
droite
et
à
gauche
par
de
larges
cloisons
vitrées
était
comme
une
grande
lanterne
transparente
où
brûlaient
violemment
deux
flammes
de
gaz
dans
un
casier
des
lettres
des
journaux
sempilaient
sur
la
table
il
avait
des
bouquets
de
fleurs
qui
attendaient
à
côté
dassiettes
sales
oubliées
et
dun
vieux
corsage
dont
la
concierge
refaisait
les
boutonnières
et
au
milieu
de
ce
désordre
de
soupente
mal
tenue
des
messieurs
du
monde
gantés
corrects
occupaient
les
quatre
vieilles
chaises
de
paille
lair
patient
et
soumis
tournant
vivement
la
tête
chaque
fois
que
madame
bron
redescendait
du
théâtre
avec
des
réponses
elle
venait
justement
de
remettre
une
lettre
à
un
jeune
homme
qui
sétait
hâté
de
louvrir
dans
le
vestibule
sous
le
bec
de
gaz
et
qui
avait
légèrement
pâli
en
trouvant
cette
phrase
classique
lue
tant
de
fois
à
cette
place
pas
possible
ce
soir
mon
chéri
je
suis
prise
la
faloise
était
sur
une
des
chaises
au
fond
entre
la
table
et
le
poêle
il
semblait
décidé
à
passer
la
soirée
là
inquiet
pourtant
rentrant
ses
longues
jambes
parce
que
toute
une
portée
de
petits
chats
noirs
sacharnaient
autour
de
lui
tandis
que
la
chatte
assise
sur
son
derrière
le
regardait
fixement
de
ses
yeux
jaunes
tiens
cest
vous
mademoiselle
simonne
que
voulezvous
donc
demanda
la
concierge
simonne
la
pria
de
faire
sortir
la
faloise
mais
madame
bron
ne
put
la
contenter
tout
de
suite
elle
tenait
sous
lescalier
dans
une
sorte
darmoire
profonde
une
buvette
où
les
figurants
descendaient
boire
pendant
les
entractes
et
comme
elle
avait
là
cinq
ou
six
grands
diables
encore
vêtus
en
chienlits
de
la
boulenoire
crevant
de
soif
et
pressés
elle
perdait
un
peu
la
tête
un
gaz
flambait
dans
larmoire
voyait
une
table
recouverte
dune
feuille
détain
et
des
planches
garnies
de
bouteilles
entamées
quand
ouvrait
la
porte
de
ce
trou
à
charbon
un
souffle
violent
dalcool
en
sortait
qui
se
mêlait
à
lodeur
de
graillon
de
la
loge
et
au
parfum
pénétrant
des
bouquets
laissés
sur
la
table
alors
reprit
la
concierge
quand
elle
eut
servi
les
figurants
cest
ce
petit
brun
làbas
que
vous
voulez
mais
non
pas
de
bêtise
dit
simonne
cest
le
maigre
à
côté
du
poêle
celui
dont
votre
chatte
sent
le
pantalon
et
elle
emmena
la
faloise
dans
le
vestibule
pendant
que
les
autres
messieurs
se
résignaient
étouffant
pris
à
la
gorge
et
que
les
chienlits
buvaient
le
long
des
marches
de
lescalier
en
sallongeant
des
claques
avec
des
gaietés
enrouées
de
soûlards
en
haut
sur
la
scène
bordenave
semportait
contre
les
machinistes
qui
nen
finissaient
pas
denlever
le
décor
cétait
fait
exprès
le

allait
recevoir
quelque
ferme
sur
la

le

enfin
la

était
libre
mignon
qui
guettait
fauchery
saisit
loccasion
pour
recommencer
ses
bourrades
il
lempoigna
dans
ses
grands
bras
en
criant
prenez
donc
garde
ce
mât
failli
vous
écraser
et
il
lemportait
et
il
le
secouait
avant
de
le
remettre
par
terre
devant
les
rires
exagérés
des
machinistes
fauchery
devint
pâle
ses
lèvres
tremblaient
il
fut
sur
le
point
de
se
révolter
pendant
que
mignon
se
faisait
bonhomme
lui
donnant
sur
lépaule
des
tapes
affectueuses
à
le
casser
en
deux
répétant
cest
que
je
tiens
à
votre
santé
moi
fichtre
je
serais
joli
sil
vous
arrivait
malheur
mais
un
murmure
courut
le
prince
le
prince
et
chacun
tourna
les
yeux
vers
la
petite
porte
de
la
salle
napercevait
encore
que
le
dos
rond
de
bordenave
avec
son
cou
de
boucher
qui
se
pliait
et
se
renflait
dans
une
série
de
saluts
obséquieux
puis
le
prince
parut
grand
fort
la
barbe
blonde
la
peau
rose
dune
distinction
de
viveur
solide
dont
les
membres
carrés
sindiquaient
sous
la
coupe
irréprochable
de
la
redingote
derrière
lui
marchaient
le
comte
muffat
et
le
marquis
de
chouard
ce
coin
du
théâtre
était
obscur
le
groupe
noyait
au
milieu
de
grandes
ombres
mouvantes
pour
parler
à
un
fils
de
reine
au
futur
héritier
dun
trône
bordenave
avait
pris
une
voix
de
montreur
dours
tremblante
dune
fausse
émotion
il
répétait
si
son
altesse
veut
bien
suivre
son
altesse
daigneraitelle
passer
par
ici
que
son
altesse
prenne
garde
le
prince
ne
se
hâtait
nullement
très
intéressé
sattardant
au
contraire
à
regarder
la
manoeuvre
des
machinistes
venait
de
descendre
une
herse
et
cette
rampe
de
gaz
suspendue
dans
ses
mailles
de
fer
éclairait
la
scène
dune
raie
large
de
clarté
muffat
surtout
qui
navait
jamais
visité
les
coulisses
dun
théâtre
sétonnait
pris
dun
malaise
dune
répugnance
vague
mêlée
de
peur
il
levait
les
yeux
vers
le
cintre
où
dautres
herses
dont
les
becs
étaient
baissés
mettaient
des
constellations
de
petites
étoiles
bleuâtres
dans
le
chaos
du
gril
et
des
fils
de
toutes
grosseurs
des
ponts
volants
des
toiles
de

étalées
en

comme
dimmenses
linges
qui
séchaient

cria
tout
à

des

et
il
fallut
que
le

prendre
les
châssis
contre
les

de
la

et
venaient
les
attacher
aux

avec
de
fortes
cordes
au
fond
pour
produire
le
coup
de
lumière
que
jetait
la
forge
ardente
de
vulcain
un
lampiste
avait
fixé
un
portant
dont
il
allumait
les
becs
garnis
de
verres
rouges
cétait
une
confusion
une
apparente
bousculade
où
les
moindres
mouvements
étaient
réglés
tandis
que
dans
cette
hâte
le
souffleur
pour
délasser
ses
jambes
se
promenait
à
petits
pas
son
altesse
comble
disait
bordenave
en
sinclinant
toujours
le
théâtre
nest
pas
grand
nous
faisons
ce
que
nous
pouvons
maintenant
si
son
altesse
daigne
suivre
déjà
le
comte
muffat
se
dirigeait
vers
le
couloir
des
loges
la
pente
assez
rapide
de
la
scène
lavait
surpris
et
son
inquiétude
venait
beaucoup
de
ce
plancher
quil
sentait
mobile
sous
ses
pieds
par
les
costières
ouvertes
apercevait
les
gaz
brûlant
dans
les
dessous
cétait
une
vie
souterraine
avec
des
profondeurs
dobscurité
des
voix
dhommes
des
souffles
de
cave
mais
comme
il
remontait
un
incident
larrêta
deux
petites
femmes
en
costume
pour
le
troisième
acte
causaient
devant
loeil
du

pour

dans

je
le

ditelle
brusquement
oh
cette
gueule
bordenave
scandalisé
se
retint
pour
ne
pas
lui
lancer
un
coup
de
pied
dans
le
derrière
mais
le
prince
souriait
lair
heureux
et
excité
davoir
entendu
ça
couvant
du
regard
la
petite
femme
qui
se
fichait
de
son
altesse
elle
riait
effrontément
cependant
bordenave
décida
le
prince
à
le
suivre
le
comte
muffat
pris
de
sueur
venait
de
retirer
son
chapeau
ce
qui
lincommodait
surtout
cétait
létouffement
de
lair
épaissi
surchauffé
où
traînait
une
odeur
forte
cette
odeur
des
coulisses
puant
le
gaz
la
colle
des
décors
la
saleté
des
coins
sombres
les
dessous
douteux
des
figurantes
dans
le
couloir
la
suffocation
augmentait
encore
des
aigreurs

de
toilette
des
parfums
de
savons
descendus
des
loges
coupaient
par
instants
lempoisonnement
des
haleines
en
passant
le
comte
leva
la
tête
jeta
un
coup
doeil
dans
la
cage
de
lescalier
saisi
du
brusque
flot
de
lumière
et
de
chaleur
qui
lui
tombait
sur
la
nuque
il
avait
en
haut
des
bruits
de
cuvette
des
rires
et
des
appels
un
vacarme
de
portes
dont
les
continuels
battements
lâchaient
des
senteurs
de
femme
le
musc
des
fards
mêlé
à
la
rudesse
fauve
des
chevelures
et
il
ne
sarrêta
pas
hâtant
sa
marche
fuyant
presque
en
emportant
à
fleur
de
peau
le
frisson
de
cette
trouée
ardente
sur
un
monde
quil
ignorait
hein
cest
curieux
un
théâtre
disait
le
marquis
de
chouard
de
lair
enchanté
dun
homme
qui
se
retrouve
chez
lui
mais
bordenave
venait
darriver
enfin
à
la
loge
de
nana
au
fond
du
couloir
il
tourna
tranquillement
le
bouton
de
la
porte
puis
seffaçant
si
son
altesse
veut
bien
entrer
un
cri
de
femme
surprise
se
fit
entendre
et
lon
vit
nana
nue
jusqu
à
la
ceinture
qui
se
sauvait
derrière
un
rideau
tandis
que
son
habilleuse
en
train
de
lessuyer
demeurait
avec
la
serviette
en
lair
oh
cest
bête
dentrer
comme
ça
criait
nana
cachée
nentrez
pas
vous
voyez
bien
quon
ne
peut
pas
entrer
bordenave
parut
mécontent
de
cette
fuite
restez
donc
chère
ça
ne
fait
rien
ditil
cest
son
altesse
allons
ne
soyez
pas
enfant
et
comme
elle
refusait
de
paraître
secouée
encore
riant
déjà
pourtant
il
ajouta
dune
voix
bourrue
et
paternelle
mon
dieu
ces
messieurs
savent
bien
comment
une
femme
est
faite
ils
ne
vous
mangeront
pas
mais
ce
nest
pas
sûr
dit
finement
le
prince
tout
le
monde
se
mit
à
rire
dune
façon
exagérée
pour
faire
sa
cour
un
mot
exquis
tout
à
fait
parisien
comme
le
remarqua
bordenave
nana
ne
répondait
plus
le
rideau
remuait
elle
se
décidait
sans
doute
alors
le
comte
muffat
le
sang
aux
joues
examina
la
loge
cétait
une
pièce
carrée
très
basse
de
plafond
tendue
entièrement
dune
étoffe
havane
clair
le
rideau
de
même
étoffe
porté
par
une
tringle
de
cuivre
ménageait
au
fond
une
sorte
de
cabinet
deux
larges
fenêtres
ouvraient
sur
la
cour
du
théâtre
à
trois
mètres
au
plus
dune
muraille
lépreuse
contre
laquelle
dans
le
noir
de
la
nuit
les
vitres
jetaient
des
carrés
jaunes
une
grande
psyché
faisait
face
à
une
toilette
de
marbre
blanc
garnie
dune
débandade
de
flacons
et
de
boîtes
de
cristal
pour
les
huiles
les
essences
et
les
poudres
le
comte
sapprocha
de
la
psyché
se
vit
très
rouge
de
fines
gouttes
de
sueur
au
front
il
baissa
les
yeux
il
vint
se
planter
devant
la
toilette
où
la
cuvette
pleine
deau
savonneuse
les
petits
outils
divoire
épars
les
éponges
humides
parurent
labsorber
un
instant
ce
sentiment
de
vertige
quil
avait
éprouvé
à
sa
première
visite
chez
nana
boulevard
haussmann
lenvahissait
de
nouveau
sous
ses
pieds
il
sentait
mollir
le
tapis
épais
de
la
loge
les
becs
de
gaz
qui
brûlaient
à
la
toilette
et
à
la
psyché
mettaient
des
sifflements
de
flamme
autour
de
ses
tempes
un
moment
craignant
de
défaillir
dans
cette
odeur
de
femme
quil
retrouvait
chauffée
décuplée
sous
le
plafond
bas
il
sassit
au
bord
du
divan
capitonné
entre
les
deux
fenêtres
mais
il
se
releva
tout
de
suite
retourna
près
de
la
toilette
ne
regarda
plus
rien
les
yeux
vagues
songeant
à
un
bouquet
de
tubéreuses
qui
sétait
fané
dans
sa
chambre
autrefois
et
dont
il
avait
failli
mourir
quand
les
tubéreuses
se
décomposent
elles
ont
une
odeur
humaine
dépêchetoi
donc
souffla
bordenave
en
passant
la
tête
derrière
le
rideau
le
prince
dailleurs
écoutait
complaisamment
le
marquis
de
chouard
qui
prenant
sur
la
toilette
la
patte
de
lièvre
expliquait
comment
étalait
le
blanc
gras
dans
un
coin
satin
avec
son
visage
pur
de
vierge
dévisageait
les
messieurs
tandis
que
lhabilleuse
madame
jules
préparait
le
maillot
et
la
tunique
de
vénus
madame
jules
navait
plus
dâge
le
visage
parcheminé
avec
ces
traits
immobiles
des
vieilles
filles
que
personne
n
connues
jeunes
cellelà
sétait
desséchée
dans
lair
embrasé
des
loges
au
milieu
des
cuisses
et
des
gorges
les
plus
célèbres
de
paris
elle
portait
une
éternelle
robe
noire
déteinte
et
sur
son
corsage
plat
et
sans
sexe
une
forêt
dépingles
étaient
piquées
à
la
place
du
coeur
je
vous
demande
pardon
messieurs
dit
nana
en
écartant
le
rideau
mais
jai
été
surprise
tous
se
tournèrent
elle
ne
sétait
pas
couverte
du
tout
elle
venait
simplement
de
boutonner
un
petit
corsage
de
percale
qui
lui
cachait
à
demi
la
gorge
lorsque
ces
messieurs
lavaient
mise
en
fuite
elle
se
déshabillait
à
peine
ôtant
vivement
son
costume
de
poissarde
parderrière
son
pantalon
laissait
passer
encore
un
bout
de
sa
chemise
et
les
bras
nus
les
épaules
nues
la
pointe
des
seins
à
lair
dans
son
adorable
jeunesse
de
blonde
grasse
elle
tenait
toujours
le
rideau
dune
main
comme
pour
le
tirer
de
nouveau
au
moindre
effarouchement
oui
jai
été
surprise
jamais
je
noserai
balbutiaitelle
en
jouant
la
confusion
avec
des
tons
roses
sur
le
cou
et
des
sourires
embarrassés
allez
donc
puisquon
vous
trouve
très
bien
cria
bordenave
elle
risqua
encore
des
mines
hésitantes
dingénue
se
remuant
comme
chatouillée
répétant
son
altesse
fait
trop
dhonneur
je
prie
son
altesse
de
mexcuser
si
je
la
reçois
ainsi
cest
moi
qui
suis
importun
dit
le
prince
mais
je
nai
pu
madame
résister
au
désir
de
vous
complimenter
alors
tranquillement
pour
aller
à
la
toilette
elle
passa
en
pantalon
au
milieu
de
ces
messieurs
qui
sécartèrent
elle
avait
les
hanches
très
fortes
le
pantalon
ballonnait
pendant
que
la
poitrine
en
avant
elle
saluait
encore
avec
son
fin
sourire
tout
dun
coup
elle
parut
reconnaître
le
comte
muffat
et
elle
lui
tendit
la
main
en
amie
puis
elle
le
gronda
de
nêtre
pas
venu
à
son
souper
son
altesse
daignait
plaisanter
muffat
qui
bégayait
frissonnant
davoir
tenu
une
seconde
dans
sa
main
brûlante
cette
petite
main
fraîche
des
eaux
de
toilette
le
comte
avait
fortement
dîné
chez
le
prince
grand
mangeur
et
beau
buveur
tous
deux
étaient
même
un
peu
gris
mais
ils
se
tenaient
très
bien
muffat
pour
cacher
son
trouble
ne
trouva
quune
phrase
sur
la
chaleur
mon
dieu
quil
fait
chaud
ici
ditil
comment
faitesvous
madame
pour
vivre
dans
une
pareille
température
et
la
conversation
allait
partir
de
là
lorsque
des
voix
bruyantes
sélevèrent
à
la
porte
de
la
loge
bordenave
tira
la
planchette
dun
judas
grillé
de
couvent

suivi
de
prullière
et
de
bosc
ayant
tous
trois
des
bouteilles
sous
les
bras
et
les
mains
chargées
de
verres
il
frappait
il
criait
que
cétait
sa
fête
quil
payait
du
champagne
nana
dun
regard
avait
consulté
le
prince
comment
donc
son
altesse
ne
voulait
gêner
personne
elle
serait
trop
heureuse
mais
sans
attendre
la
permission
fontan
entrait
zézayant
répétant

du
champagne
brusquement
il
aperçut
le
prince
quil
ne
savait
pas
là
il
sarrêta
court
il
prit
un
air
de
bouffonne
solennité
en
disant
le
roi
dagobert

dans
le
corridor
qui
demande
à
trinquer
avec
son
altesse
royale
le
prince
ayant
souri
trouva
ça
charmant
cependant
la
loge
était
trop
petite
pour
tout
ce
monde
il
fallut
sentasser
satin
et
madame
jules
au
fond
contre
le
rideau
les
hommes
serrés
autour
de
nana
deminue
les
trois
acteurs
avaient
encore
leurs
costumes
du
second
acte
tandis
que

ôtait
son
chapeau

avec
sa

raffermissait
sur

et
saluait
le
prince
en
monarque
qui
reçoit
le
fils
dun
puissant
voisin

complaisamment

attendit
il
salua
trois
fois
en
murmurant
madame

dun
trait

et
le

à
la
cour

dans
une
farce
grave

la
buée
ardente
du
gaz
nana
oubliant
quelle
était
en
pantalon
avec
son
bout
de
chemise
jouait
la
grande

la
reine

ouvrant
ses
petits
appartements
aux
personnages

chaque
phrase

lâchait
les
mots

faisait
des
révérences
convaincues
traitait
ces
chienlits
de
bosc
et
de
prullière
en
souverain
que
son
ministre
accompagne
et
personne
ne
souriait
de
cet
étrange
mélange
de
ce
vrai
prince
héritier
dun
trône
qui
buvait
le
champagne
dun
cabotin
très
à
laise
dans
ce
carnaval
des
dieux
dans
cette
mascarade
de
la
royauté
au
milieu
dun
peuple
dhabilleuses
et
de
filles
de
rouleurs
de
planches
et
de
montreurs
de
femmes
bordenave
enlevé
par
cette
mise
en
scène
songeait
aux
recettes
quil
ferait
si
son
altesse
avait
consenti
à
paraître
comme
ça
au
second
acte
de
la
blonde
vénus
dites
donc
criatil
devenant
familier
nous
allons
faire
descendre
mes
petites
femmes
nana
ne
voulut
pas

pourtant
se
lâchait
fontan
lattirait
avec
son
masque
de
grotesque
se
frottant
contre
lui
le
couvant
dun
regard
de
femme
enceinte
qui
envie
de
manger
quelque
chose
de
malpropre
elle
le
tutoya
tout
à
coup
voyons
verse
grande
bête
fontan
remplit
de
nouveau
les
verres
et
lon
en
répétant
les
mêmes
toasts
son
altesse
larmée
vénus
mais
nana
réclamait
le
silence
du
geste
elle
leva
son
verre
très
haut
elle
dit
non
non
à
fontan
cest
la
fête
de
fontan
à
fontan
à
fontan
alors
trinqua
une
troisième
fois
acclama
fontan
le
prince
qui
avait
regardé
la
jeune
femme
manger
le
comique
des
yeux
salua
celuici
monsieur
fontan
ditil
avec
sa
haute
politesse
je
bois
à
vos
succès
cependant
la
redingote
de
son
altesse
essuyait
derrière
elle
le
marbre
de
la
toilette
cétait
comme
un
fond
dalcôve
comme
une
étroite
chambre
de
bain
avec
la
vapeur
de
la
cuvette
et
des
éponges
le
violent
parfum
des
essences
mêlé
à
la
pointe
divresse
aigrelette
du
vin
de
champagne
le
prince
et
le
comte
muffat
entre
lesquels
nana
se
trouvait
prise
devaient
lever
les
mains
pour
ne
pas
lui
frôler
les
hanches
ou
la
gorge
au
moindre
geste
et
sans
une
goutte
de
sueur
madame
jules
attendait
de
son
air
raide
tandis
que
satin
étonnée
dans
son
vice
de
voir
un
prince
et
des
messieurs
en
habit
se
mettre
avec
des
déguisés
après
une
femme
nue
songeait
tout
bas
que
les
gens
chic
nétaient
déjà
pas
si
propres
mais
dans
le
couloir
le
tintement
de
la
sonnette
du
père
barillot
approchait
quand
il
parut
à
la
porte
de
la
loge
il
resta
saisi
en
apercevant
les
trois
acteurs
encore
dans
leurs
costumes
du
second
acte
oh
messieurs
messieurs
bégayatil
dépêchezvous
vient
de
sonner
au
foyer
du
public
bah
dit
tranquillement
bordenave
le
public
attendra
toutefois
après
de
nouveaux
saluts
comme
les
bouteilles
étaient
vides
les
comédiens
montèrent
shabiller
bosc
ayant
trempé
sa
barbe
de
champagne
venait
de
lôter
et
sous
cette
barbe
vénérable
livrogne
avait
brusquement
reparu
avec
sa
face
ravagée
et
bleuie
de
vieil
acteur
tombé
dans
le
vin
lentendit
au
pied
de
lescalier
qui
disait
à
fontan
de
sa
voix
de
rogomme
en
parlant
du
prince
hein
je
lai
épaté
il
ne
restait
dans
la
loge
de
nana
que
son
altesse
le
comte
et
le
marquis
bordenave
sétait
éloigné
avec
barillot
auquel
il
recommandait
de
ne
pas
frapper
sans
avertir
madame
messieurs
vous
permettez
demanda
nana
qui
se
mit
à
refaire
ses
bras
et
sa
figure
quelle
soignait
surtout
pour
le
nu
du
troisième
acte
le
prince
prit
place
sur
le
divan
avec
le
marquis
de
chouard
seul
le
comte
muffat
demeurait
debout
les
deux
verres
de
champagne
dans
cette
chaleur
suffocante
avaient
augmenté
leur
ivresse
satin
en
voyant
les
messieurs
senfermer
avec
son
amie
avait
cru
discret
de
disparaître
derrière
le
rideau
et
elle
attendait
là
sur
une
malle
embêtée
de
poser
pendant
que
madame
jules
allait
et
venait
tranquillement
sans
un
mot
sans
un
regard
vous
avez
merveilleusement
chanté
votre
ronde
dit
le
prince
alors
la
conversation
sétablit
mais
par
courtes
phrases
coupées
de
silences
nana
ne
pouvait
toujours
répondre
après
sêtre
passé
du
coldcream
avec
la
main
sur
les
bras
et
sur
la
figure
elle
étalait
le
blanc
gras
à
laide
dun
coin
de
serviette
un
instant
elle
cessa
de
se
regarder
dans
la
glace
elle
sourit
en
glissant
un
regard
vers
le
prince
sans
lâcher
le
blanc
gras
son
altesse
gâte
murmuratelle
cétait
toute
une
besogne
compliquée
que
le
marquis
de
chouard
suivait
dun
air
de
jouissance
béate
il
parla
à
son
tour
lorchestre
ditil
ne
pourraitil
pas
vous
accompagner
plus
en
sourdine
il
couvre
votre
voix
cest
un
crime
impardonnable
cette
fois
nana
ne
se
retourna
point
elle
avait
pris
la
patte
de
lièvre
elle
la
promenait
légèrement
très
attentive
si
cambrée
audessus
de
la
toilette
que
la
rondeur
blanche
de
son
pantalon
saillait
et
se
tendait
avec
le
petit
bout
de
chemise
mais
elle
voulut
se
montrer
sensible
au
compliment
du
vieillard
elle
sagita
en
balançant
les
hanches
un
silence
régna
madame
jules
avait
remarqué
une
déchirure
à
la
jambe
droite
du
pantalon
elle
prit
une
épingle
sur
son
coeur
elle
resta
un
moment
par
terre
à
genoux
occupée
autour
de
la
cuisse
de
nana
pendant
que
la
jeune
femme
sans
paraître
la
savoir
là
se
couvrait
de
poudre
de
riz
en
évitant
soigneusement
den
mettre
sur
les
pommettes
mais
comme
le
prince
disait
que
si
elle
venait
chanter
à
londres
toute
langleterre
voudrait
lapplaudir
elle
eut
un
rire
aimable
elle
se
tourna
une
seconde
la
joue
gauche
très
blanche
au
milieu
dun
nuage
de
poudre
puis
elle
devint
subitement
sérieuse
il
sagissait
de
mettre
le
rouge
de
nouveau
le
visage
près
de
la
glace
elle
trempait
son
doigt
dans
un
pot
elle
appliquait
le
rouge
sous
les
yeux
létalait
doucement
jusqu
à
la
tempe
ces
messieurs
se
taisaient
respectueux
le
comte
muffat
navait
pas
encore
ouvert
les
lèvres
il
songeait
invinciblement
à
sa
jeunesse
sa
chambre
denfant
était
toute
froide
plus
tard
à
seize
ans
lorsquil
embrassait
sa
mère
chaque
soir
il
emportait
jusque
dans
son
sommeil
la
glace
de
ce
baiser
un
jour
en
passant
il
avait
aperçu
par
une
porte
entrebâillée
une
servante
qui
se
débarbouillait
et
cétait
lunique
souvenir
qui
leût
troublé
de
la
puberté
à
son
mariage
puis
il
avait
trouvé
chez
sa
femme
une
stricte
obéissance
aux
devoirs
conjugaux
luimême
éprouvait
une
sorte
de
répugnance
dévote
il
grandissait
il
vieillissait
ignorant
de
la
chair
plié
à
de
rigides
pratiques
religieuses
ayant
réglé
sa
vie
sur
des
préceptes
et
des
lois
et
brusquement
le
jetait
dans
cette
loge
dactrice
devant
cette
fille
nue
lui
qui
navait
jamais
vu
la
comtesse
muffat
mettre
ses
jarretières
il
assistait
aux
détails
intimes
dune
toilette
de
femme
dans
la
débandade
des
pots
et
des
cuvettes
au
milieu
de
cette
odeur
si
forte
et
si
douce
tout
son
être
se
révoltait
la
lente
possession
dont
nana
lenvahissait
depuis
quelque
temps
leffrayait
en
lui
rappelant
ses
lectures
de
piété
les
possessions
diaboliques
qui
avaient
bercé
son
enfance
il
croyait
au
diable
nana
confusément
était
le
diable
avec
ses
rires
avec
sa
gorge
et
sa
croupe
gonflées
de
vices
mais
il
se
promettait
dêtre
fort
il
saurait
se
défendre
alors
cest
convenu
disait
le
prince
très
à
laise
sur
le
divan
vous
venez
lannée
prochaine
à
londres
et
nous
vous
recevons
si
bien
que
jamais
plus
vous
ne
retournerez
en
france
ah
voilà
mon
cher
comte
vous
ne
faites
pas
un
assez
grand
cas
de
vos
jolies
femmes
nous
vous
les
prendrons
toutes
ça
ne
le
gênera
guère
murmura
méchamment
le
marquis
de
chouard
qui
se
risquait
dans
lintimité
le
comte
est
la
vertu
même
en
entendant
parler
de
sa
vertu
nana
le
regarda
si
drôlement
que
muffat
éprouva
une
vive
contrariété
ensuite
ce
mouvement
le
surprit
et
le
fâcha
contre
luimême
pourquoi
lidée
dêtre
vertueux
le
gênaitelle
devant
cette
fille
il
laurait
battue
mais
nana
en
voulant
prendre
un
pinceau
venait
de
le
laisser
tomber
et
comme
elle
se
baissait
il
se
précipita
leurs
souffles
se
rencontrèrent
les
cheveux
dénoués
de
vénus
lui
roulèrent
sur
les
mains
ce
fut
une
jouissance
mêlée
de
remords
une
de
ces
jouissances
de
catholique
que
la
peur
de
lenfer
aiguillonne
dans
le
péché
ce
moment
la
voix
du
père
barillot
séleva
derrière
la
porte
madame
puisje
frapper
simpatiente
dans
la
salle
tout
à
lheure
répondit
tranquillement
nana
elle
avait
trempé

le

sur

le
passa
délicatement
entre
les
cils

elle
regardait
il
la
voyait
dans
la
glace
avec
ses
épaules
rondes
et
sa
gorge
noyée
dune
ombre
rose
et
il
ne
pouvait
malgré
son
effort
se
détourner
de
ce
visage
que
loeil
fermé
rendait
si
provocant
troué
de
fossettes
comme
pâmé
de
désirs
lorsquelle
ferma
loeil
droit
et
quelle
passa
le
pinceau
il
comprit
quil

appartenait
madame
cria
de
nouveau
la
voix
essoufflée
de
lavertisseur
ils
tapent
des

ils
vont
finir
par
casser
les
banquettes
puisje

ils
mattendront
elle
se
calma
elle
ajouta
avec
un
sourire
en
se
tournant
vers
ces
messieurs
cest
vrai
ne
peut
seulement
causer
une
minute
maintenant
sa
figure
et
ses
bras
étaient
faits
elle
ajouta
avec
le
doigt
deux
larges
traits
de
carmin
sur
les
lèvres
le
comte
muffat
se
sentait
plus
troublé
encore
séduit
par
la
perversion
des
poudres
et
des
fards
pris
du
désir
déréglé
de
cette
jeunesse
peinte
la
bouche
trop
rouge
dans
la
face
trop
blanche
les
yeux
agrandis
cerclés
de
noir
brûlants
et
comme
meurtris
damour
cependant
nana
passa
un
instant
derrière
le
rideau
pour
enfiler
le
maillot
de
vénus
après
avoir
ôté
son
pantalon
puis
tranquille
dimpudeur
elle
vint
déboutonner
son
petit
corsage
de
percale
en
tendant
les
bras
à
madame
jules
qui
lui
passa
les
courtes
manches
de
la
tunique
vite
puisquils
se
fâchent
murmuratelle
le
prince
les
yeux
à
demi
clos
suivit
en
connaisseur
les
lignes
renflées
de
sa
gorge
tandis
que
le
marquis
de
chouard
eut
un
hochement
de
tête
involontaire
muffat
pour
ne
plus
voir
regarda
le
tapis
dailleurs
vénus
était
prête
elle
portait
simplement
cette
gaze
aux
épaules
madame
jules
tournait
autour
delle
de
son
air
de
petite
vieille
en
bois
aux
yeux
vides
et
clairs
et
vivement
elle
prenait
des
épingles
sur
la
pelote
inépuisable
de
son
coeur
elle
épinglait
la
tunique
de
vénus
frôlant
toutes
ces
grasses
nudités
de
ses
mains
séchées
sans
un
souvenir
et
comme
désintéressée
de
son
sexe
voilà
dit
la
jeune
femme
en
se
donnant
un
dernier
coup
doeil
dans
la
glace
bordenave
revenait
inquiet
disant
que
le
troisième
acte
était
commencé
eh
bien
j
vais
repritelle
en
voilà
des
affaires
cest
toujours
moi
qui
attends
les
autres
ces
messieurs
sortirent
de
la
loge
mais
ils
ne
prirent
pas
congé
le
prince
avait
témoigné
le
désir
dassister
au
troisième
acte
dans
les
coulisses
restée
seule
nana
sétonna
promenant
ses
regards
où
estelle
donc
demandatelle
elle
cherchait
satin
lorsquelle
leut
retrouvée
derrière
le
rideau
attendant
sur
la
malle
satin
lui
répondit
tranquillement
bien
sûr
que
je
ne
voulais
pas
te
gêner
avec
tous
ces
hommes
et
elle
ajouta
que
maintenant
elle
sen
allait
mais
nana
la
retint
étaitelle
bête
puisque
bordenave
consentait
à
la
prendre
terminerait
laffaire
après
le
spectacle
satin
hésitait
il
avait
trop
de
machines
ce
nétait
plus
son
monde
pourtant
elle
resta
comme
le
prince
descendait
le
petit
escalier
de
bois
un
bruit
étrange
des
jurons
étouffés
des
piétinements
de
lutte
éclataient
de
lautre
côté
du
théâtre
cétait
toute
une
histoire
qui
effarait
les
artistes
attendant
leur
réplique
depuis
un
instant
mignon
plaisantait
de
nouveau
en
bourrant
fauchery
de
caresses
il
venait
dinventer
un
petit
jeu
il
lui
appliquait
des
pichenettes
sur
le
nez
pour
le
garantir
des
mouches
disaitil
naturellement
ce
jeu
divertissait
fort
les
artistes
mais
tout
à
coup
mignon
emporté
par
son
succès
se
lançant
dans
la
fantaisie
avait
allongé
au
journaliste
un
soufflet
un
véritable
et
vigoureux
soufflet
cette
fois
il
allait
trop
loin
fauchery
ne
pouvait
devant
le
monde
accepter
en
riant
une
pareille
gifle
et
les
deux
hommes
cessant
la
comédie
livides
et
le
visage
crevant
de
haine
sétaient
sauté
à
la
gorge
ils
se
roulaient
par
terre
derrière
un
portant
en
se
traitant
de
maquereaux
monsieur
bordenave
monsieur
bordenave
vint
dire
le
régisseur
effaré
bordenave
le
suivit
après
avoir
demandé
pardon
au
prince
quand
il
eut
reconnu
par
terre
fauchery
et
mignon
il
laissa
échapper
un
geste
dhomme
contrarié
vraiment
ils
prenaient
bien
leur
temps
avec
son
altesse
de
lautre
côté
du
décor
et
toute
cette
salle
qui
pouvait
entendre
pour
comble
dennui
rose
mignon
arrivait
essoufflée
juste
à
la
minute
de
son
entrée
en
scène
vulcain
lui
jetait
sa
réplique
mais
rose
resta
stupéfaite
en
voyant
à
ses
pieds
son
mari
et
son
amant
qui
se
vautraient
sétranglant
ruant
les
cheveux
arrachés
la
redingote
blanche
de
poussière
ils
lui
barraient
le
passage
même
un
machiniste
avait
arrêté
le
chapeau
de
fauchery
au
moment
où
ce
diable
de
chapeau
dans
la
lutte
allait
rebondir
sur
la
scène
cependant
vulcain
qui
inventait
des
phrases
pour
amuser
le
public
donnait
de
nouveau
la
réplique
rose
immobile
regardait
toujours
les
deux
hommes
mais
ne
regarde
donc
pas
lui
souffla
furieusement
bordenave
dans
le
cou
va
donc
va
donc
ce
nest
pas
ton
affaire
tu
manques
ton
entrée
et
poussée
par
lui
rose
enjambant
les
corps
se
trouva
en
scène
dans
le
flamboiement
de
la
rampe
devant
le
public
elle
navait
pas
compris
pourquoi
ils
étaient
par
terre
à
se
battre
tremblante
la
tête
emplie
dun
bourdonnement
elle
descendit
vers
la
rampe
avec
son
beau
sourire
de
diane
amoureuse
et
elle
attaqua
la
première
phrase
de
son
duo
dune
voix
si
chaude
que
le
public
lui
fit
une
ovation
derrière
le
décor
elle
entendait
les
coups
sourds
des
deux
hommes
ils
avaient
roulé
jusquau
manteau
darlequin
heureusement
la
musique
couvrait
le
bruit
des
ruades
quils
donnaient
dans
les
châssis
nom
de
dieu
cria
bordenave
exaspéré
lorsquil
eut
enfin
réussi
à
les
séparer
estce
que
vous
ne
pourriez
pas
vous
battre
chez
vous
vous
savez
pourtant
bien
que
je
naime
pas
ça
toi
mignon
tu
vas
faire
le
plaisir
de
rester
ici
côté
cour
et
vous
fauchery
je
vous
flanque
à
la
porte
du
théâtre
si
vous
quittez
le
côté
jardin
hein
cest
entendu
côté
cour
et
côté
jardin
ou
je
défends
à
rose
de
vous
amener
quand
il
revint
près
du
prince
celuici
sinforma
oh
rien
du
tout
murmuratil
dun
air
calme
nana
debout
enveloppée
dans
une
fourrure
attendait
son
entrée
en
causant
avec
ces
messieurs
comme
le
comte
muffat
remontait
pour
jeter
un
regard
sur
la
scène
entre
deux
châssis
il
comprit
à
un
geste
du
régisseur
quil
devait
marcher
doucement
une
paix
chaude
tombait
du
cintre
dans
les
coulisses
éclairées
de
violentes
nappes
de
lumière
de
rares
personnes
parlant
à
voix
basse
stationnaient
sen
allaient
sur
la
pointe
des
pieds
le
gazier
était
à
son
poste
près
du
jeu
compliqué
des
robinets
un
pompier
appuyé
contre
un
portant
tâchait
de
voir
en
allongeant
la
tête
pendant
que
tout
en
haut
sur
son
banc
lhomme
du
rideau
veillait
lair
résigné
ignorant
la
pièce
toujours
dans
lattente
du
coup
de
sonnette
pour
la
manoeuvre
de
ses
cordages
et
au
milieu
de
cet
air
étouffé
de
ces
piétinements
et
de
ces
chuchotements
la
voix
des
acteurs
en
scène
arrivait
étrange
assourdie
une
voix
dont
la
fausseté
surprenait
puis
cétait
plus
loin
audelà
des
bruits
confus
de
lorchestre
comme
une
immense
haleine
la
salle
qui
respirait
et
dont
le
souffle
se
gonflait
parfois
éclatant
en
rumeurs
en
rires
en
applaudissements
sentait
le
public
sans
le
voir
même
dans
ses
silences
mais
il
quelque
chose
douvert
dit
brusquement
nana
en
ramenant
les
coins
de
sa
fourrure
voyez
donc
barillot
je
parie
quon
vient
douvrir
une
fenêtre
vrai
peut
crever
ici
barillot
jura
quil
avait
tout
fermé
luimême
peutêtre
avaitil
des
carreaux
cassés
les
artistes
se
plaignaient
toujours
des
courants
dair
dans
la
chaleur
lourde
du
gaz
des
coups
de
froid
passaient
un
vrai
nid
à
fluxions
de
poitrine
comme
disait
fontan
je
voudrais
vous
voir
décolleté
continua
nana
qui
se
fâchait
chut
murmura
bordenave
en
scène
rose
détaillait
si
finement
une
phrase
de
son
duo
que
des
bravos
couvrirent
lorchestre
nana
se
tut
la
face
sérieuse
cependant
le
comte
se
risquait
dans
une
rue
lorsque
barillot
larrêta
en
lavertissant
quil
avait
là
une
découverte
il
voyait
le
décor
à
lenvers
et
de
biais
le
derrière
des
châssis
consolidés
par
une
épaisse
couche
de
vieilles
affiches
puis
un
coin
de
la
scène
la
caverne
de
letna
creusée
dans
une
mine
dargent
avec
la
forge
de
vulcain
au
fond
les
herses
descendues
incendiaient
le
paillon
appliqué
à
larges
coups
de
pinceau
des
portants
à
verres
bleus
et
à
verres
rouges
par
une
opposition
calculée
ménageaient
un
flamboiement
de
brasier
tandis
que
par
terre
au
troisième
plan
des
traînées
de
gaz
couraient
pour
détacher
une
barre
de
roches
noires
et
là
sur
un
praticable
incliné
en
pente
douce
au
milieu
de
ces
gouttes
de
lumière
pareilles
à
des
lampions
posés
dans
lherbe
un
soir
de
fête
publique
la
vieille
madame
drouard
qui
jouait
junon
était
assise
aveuglée
et
somnolente
attendant
son
entrée
mais
il
eut
un
mouvement
simonne
en
train
découter
une
histoire
de
clarisse
laissa
échapper
tiens
la
tricon
cétait
la
tricon
en
effet
avec
ses
anglaises
et
sa
tournure
de
comtesse
qui
court
les
avoués
quand
elle
aperçut
nana
elle
marcha
droit
à
elle
non
dit
celleci
après
un
échange
rapide
de
paroles
pas
maintenant
la
vieille
dame
resta
grave
prullière
en
passant
lui
donna
une
poignée
de
main
deux
petites
figurantes
la
contemplaient
avec
émotion
elle
un
moment
parut
hésitante
puis
elle
appela
simonne
dun
geste
et
léchange
rapide
de
paroles
recommença
oui
dit
enfin
simonne
dans
une
demiheure
mais
comme
elle
remontait
à
sa
loge
madame
bron
qui
se
promenait
de
nouveau
avec
des
lettres
lui
en
remit
une
bordenave
baissant
la
voix
reprochait
furieusement
à
la
concierge
davoir
laissé
passer
la
tricon
cette
femme
juste
ce
soirlà
ça
lindignait
à
cause
de
son
altesse
madame
bron
depuis
trente
ans
dans
le
théâtre
répondit
sur
un
ton
daigreur
estce
quelle
savait
la
tricon
faisait
des
affaires
avec
toutes
ces
dames
vingt
fois
monsieur
le
directeur
lavait
rencontrée
sans
rien
dire
et
pendant
que
bordenave
mâchait
de
gros
mots
la
tricon
tranquille
examinait
fixement
le
prince
en
femme
qui
pèse
un
homme
dun
regard
un
sourire
éclaira
son
visage
jaune
puis
elle
sen
alla
dun
pas
lent
au
milieu
des
petites
femmes
respectueuses
tout
de
suite
nestce
pas
ditelle
en
se
retournant
vers
simonne
simonne
semblait
fort
ennuyée
la
lettre
était
dun
jeune
homme
auquel
elle
avait
promis
pour
le
soir
elle
remit
à
madame
bron
un
billet
griffonné
pas
possible
ce
soir
mon
chéri
je
suis
prise
mais
elle
restait
inquiète
ce
jeune
homme
allait
peutêtre
lattendre
quand
même
comme
elle
nétait
pas
du
troisième
acte
elle
voulait
partir
tout
de
suite
alors
elle
pria
clarisse
daller
voir
celleci
entrait
seulement
en
scène
vers
la
fin
de
lacte
elle
descendit
pendant
que
simonne
remontait
un
instant
à
la
loge
quelles
occupaient
en
commun
en
bas
dans
la
buvette
de
madame
bron
un
figurant
chargé
du
rôle
de
pluton
buvait
seul
drapé
dune
grande
robe
rouge
à
flammes
dor
le
petit
commerce
de
la
concierge
avait
dû
bien
marcher
car
le
trou
de
cave
sous
lescalier
était
tout
humide
des
rinçures
de
verre
répandues
clarisse
releva
sa
tunique
diris
qui
traînait
sur
les
marches
grasses
mais
elle
sarrêta
prudemment
elle
se
contenta
dallonger
la
tête
au
tournant
de
lescalier
pour
jeter
un
coup
doeil
dans
la
loge
et
elle
avait
eu
du
flair
estce
que
cet
idiot
de
la
faloise
nétait
pas
encore
là
sur
la
même
chaise
entre
la
table
et
le
poêle
il
avait
fait
mine
de
filer
devant
simonne
puis
il
était
revenu
dailleurs
la
loge
était
toujours
pleine
de
messieurs
gantés
corrects
lair
soumis
et
patient
tous
attendaient
en
se
regardant
avec
gravité
il
n
avait
plus
sur
la
table
que
les
assiettes
sales
madame
bron
venait
de
distribuer
les
derniers
bouquets
seule
une
rose
tombée
se
fanait
près
de
la
chatte
noire
qui
sétait
couchée
en
rond
tandis
que
les
petits
chats
exécutaient
des
courses
folles
des
galops
féroces
entre
les
jambes
des
messieurs
clarisse
eut
un
instant
lenvie
de
flanquer
la
faloise
dehors
ce
crétinlà
naimait
pas
les
bêtes
ça
le
complétait
il
rentrait
les
coudes
à
cause
de
la
chatte
pour
ne
pas
la
toucher
il
va
te
pincer
méfietoi
dit
pluton
un
farceur
qui
remontait
en
sessuyant
les
lèvres
dun
revers
de
main
alors
clarisse
lâcha
lidée
de
faire
une
scène
à
la
faloise
elle
avait
vu
madame
bron
remettre
la
lettre
au
jeune
homme
de
simonne
celuici
était
allé
la
lire
sous
le
bec
de
gaz
du
vestibule
pas
possible
ce
soir
mon
chéri
je
suis
prise
et
paisiblement
habitué
à
la
phrase
sans
doute
il
avait
disparu
au
moins
en
voilà
un
qui
savait
se
conduire
ce
nétait
pas
comme
les
autres
ceux
qui
sentêtaient
là
sur
les
chaises
dépaillées
de
madame
bron
dans
cette
grande
lanterne
vitrée
où
lon
cuisait
et
qui
ne
sentait
guère
bon
fallaitil
que
ça
tint
les
hommes
clarisse
remonta
dégoûtée
elle
traversa
la
scène
elle
grimpa
lestement
les
trois
étages
de
lescalier
des
loges
pour
rendre
réponse
à
simonne
sur
le
théâtre
le
prince
sécartant
parlait
à
nana
il
ne
lavait
pas
quittée
il
la
couvait
de
ses
yeux
demiclos
nana
sans
le
regarder
souriante
disait
oui
dun
signe
de
tête
mais
brusquement
le
comte
muffat
obéit
à
une
poussée
de
tout
son
être
il
lâcha
bordenave
qui
lui
donnait
des
détails
sur
la
manoeuvre
des
treuils
et
des
tambours
et
sapprocha
pour
rompre
cet
entretien
nana
leva
les
yeux
lui
sourit
comme
elle
souriait
à
son
altesse
cependant
elle
avait
toujours
une
oreille
tendue
guettant
la
réplique
le
troisième
acte
est
le
plus
court
je
crois
disait
le
prince
gêné
par
la
présence
du
comte
elle
ne
répondit
pas
la
face
changée
tout
dun
coup
à
son
affaire
dun
rapide
mouvement
des
épaules
elle
avait
fait
glisser
sa
fourrure
que
madame
jules
debout
derrière
elle
reçut
dans
ses
bras
et
nue
après
avoir
porté
les
deux
mains
à
sa
chevelure
comme
pour
lassujettir
elle
entra
en
scène
chut
chut
souffla
bordenave
le
comte
et
le
prince
étaient
restés
surpris
au
milieu
du
grand
silence
un
soupir
profond
une
lointaine
rumeur
de
foule
montait
chaque
soir
le
même
effet
se
produisait
à
lentrée
de
vénus
dans
sa
nudité
de
déesse
alors
muffat
voulut
voir
il
appliqua
loeil
à
un
trou
audelà
de
larc
de
cercle
éblouissant
de
la
rampe
la
salle
paraissait
sombre
comme
emplie
dune
fumée
rousse
et
sur
ce
fond
neutre
où
les
rangées
de
visages
mettaient
une
pâleur
brouillée
nana
se
détachait
en
blanc
grandie
bouchant
les
loges
du
balcon
au
cintre
il
lapercevait
de
dos
les
reins
tendus
les
bras
ouverts
tandis
que
par
terre
au
ras
de
ses
pieds
la
tête
du
souffleur
une
tête
de
vieil
homme
était
posée
comme
coupée
avec
un
air
pauvre
et
honnête
certaines
phrases
de
son
morceau

à
sa

au
bord
traînant
de
sa

quand
elle
eut
poussé
la
dernière
note
au

dune
tempête
de
bravos
elle
salua
les
gazes
volantes
sa
chevelure
touchant
ses
reins
dans
le
raccourci
de

et
en
la
voyant
ainsi
pliée
et
les

à

vers
le

par

la

de

à

sétirant
et
bâillant
avant

en

tous
éteints
les
yeux
rouges
pressés
daller
se
coucher
ce
moment
fauchery
qui
rôdait
du
côté
jardin
depuis
que
bordenave
lui
avait
interdit
le
côté
cour
saccrocha
au
comte
pour
se
donner
une
contenance
en
offrant
de
lui
montrer
les
loges
muffat
quune
mollesse
croissante
laissait
sans
volonté
finit
par
suivre
le
journaliste
après
avoir
cherché
des
yeux
le
marquis
de
chouard
qui
nétait
plus
là
il
éprouvait
à
la
fois
un
soulagement
et
une
inquiétude
en
quittant
ces
coulisses
doù
il
entendait
nana
chanter
déjà
fauchery
le
précédait
dans
lescalier
que
des
tambours
de
bois
fermaient
au
premier
étage
et
au
second
cétait
un
de
ces
escaliers
de
maison
louche
comme
le
comte
muffat
en
avait
vu
dans
ses
tournées
de
membre
du
bureau
de
bienfaisance
nu
et
délabré
badigeonné
de
jaune
avec
des
marches
usées
par
la
dégringolade
des
pieds
et
une
rampe
de
fer
que
le
frottement
des
mains
avait
polie
chaque
palier
au
ras
du
sol
une
fenêtre
basse
mettait
un
enfoncement
carré
de
soupirail
dans
des
lanternes
scellées
aux
murs
des
flammes
de
gaz
brûlaient
éclairant
crûment
cette
misère
dégageant
une
chaleur
qui
montait
et
samassait
sous
la
spirale
étroite
des
étages
en
arrivant
au
pied
de
lescalier
le
comte
avait
senti
de
nouveau
un
souffle
ardent
lui
tomber
sur
la
nuque
cette
odeur
de
femme
descendue
des
loges
dans
un
flot
de
lumière
et
de
bruit
et
maintenant
à
chaque
marche
quil
montait
le
musc
des
poudres
les
aigreurs
des
vinaigres
de
toilette
le
chauffaient
létourdissaient
davantage
au
premier
deux
corridors
senfonçaient
tournaient
brusquement
avec
des
portes
dhôtel
meublé
suspect
peintes
en
jaune
portant
de
gros
numéros
blancs
par
terre
les
carreaux
descellés
faisaient
des
bosses
dans
le
tassement
de
la
vieille
maison
le
comte
se
hasarda
jeta
un
coup
doeil
par
une
porte
entrouverte
vit
une
pièce
très
sale
une
échoppe
de
perruquier
de
faubourg
meublée
de
deux
chaises
dune
glace
et
dune
planchette
à
tiroir
noircie
par
la
crasse
des
peignes
un
gaillard
en
sueur
les
épaules
fumantes
changeait
de
linge
tandis
que
dans
une
chambre
pareille
à
côté
une
femme
près
de
partir
mettait
ses
gants
les
cheveux
défrisés
et
mouillés
comme
si
elle
venait
de
prendre
un
bain
mais
fauchery
appelait
le
comte
et
celuici
arrivait
au
second
lorsquun
nom
de
dieu
furieux
sortit
du
corridor
de
droite
mathilde
un
petit
torchon
dingénue
venait
de
casser
sa
cuvette
dont
leau
savonneuse
coulait
jusquau
palier
une
loge
se
referma
violemment
deux
femmes
en
corset
traversèrent
dun
saut
une
autre
le
bord
de
sa
chemise
aux
dents
parut
et
se
sauva
puis
il
eut
des
rires
une
querelle
une
chanson
commencée
et
tout
dun
coup
interrompue
le
long
du
couloir
par
les
fentes
apercevait
des
coins
de
nudité
des
blancheurs
de
peau
des
pâleurs
de
linge
deux
filles
très
gaies
se
montraient
leurs
signes
une
toute
jeune
presque
une
enfant
avait
relevé
ses
jupons
audessus
des
genoux
pour
recoudre
son
pantalon
pendant
que
les
habilleuses
en
voyant
les
deux
hommes
tiraient
légèrement
des
rideaux
par
décence
cétait
la
bousculade
de
la
fin
le
grand
nettoyage
du
blanc
et
du
rouge
la
toilette
de
ville
reprise
au
milieu
dun
nuage
de
poudre
de
riz
un
redoublement
dodeur
fauve
soufflé
par
les
portes
battantes
au
troisième
étage
muffat
sabandonna
à
la
griserie
qui
lenvahissait
la
loge
des
figurantes
était
là
vingt
femmes
entassées
une
débandade
de
savons
et
de
bouteilles
deau
de
lavande
la
salle
commune
dune
maison
de
barrière
en
passant
il
entendit
derrière
une
porte
close
un
lavage
féroce
une
tempête
dans
une
cuvette
et
il
montait
au
dernier
étage
lorsquil
eut
la
curiosité
de
hasarder
encore
un
regard
par
un
judas
resté
ouvert
la
pièce
était
vide
il
n
avait
sous
le
flamboiement
du
gaz
quun
pot
de
chambre
oublié
au
milieu
dun
désordre
de
jupes
traînant
par
terre
cette
pièce
fut
la
dernière
vision
quil
emporta
en
haut
au
quatrième
il
étouffait
toutes
les
odeurs
toutes
les
flammes
venaient
frapper
là
le
plafond
jaune
semblait
cuit
une
lanterne
brûlait
dans
un
brouillard
roussâtre
un
instant
il
se
tint
à
la
rampe
de
fer
quil
trouva
tiède
dune
tiédeur
vivante
et
il
ferma
les
yeux
et
il
dans
une
aspiration
tout
le
sexe
de
la
femme
quil
ignorait
encore
et
qui
lui
battait
le
visage
arrivez
donc
cria
fauchery
disparu
depuis
un
moment
vous
demande
cétait
au
fond
du
corridor
la
loge
de
clarisse
et
de
simonne
une
pièce
en
longueur
sous
les
toits
mal
faite
avec
des
pans
coupés
et
des
fuites
de
mur
le
jour
venait
den
haut
par
deux
ouvertures
profondes
mais
à
cette
heure
de
nuit
des
flammes
de
gaz
éclairaient
la
loge
tapissée
dun
papier
à
sept
sous
le
rouleau
des
fleurs
roses
courant
sur
un
treillage
vert
côte
à
côte
deux
planches
servaient
de
toilette
des
planches
garnies
dune
toile
cirée
noire
deau
répandue
et
sous
lesquelles
traînaient
des
brocs
de
zinc
bossués
des
seaux
pleins
de
rinçures
des
cruches
de
grosse
poterie
jaune
il
avait
là
un
étalage
darticles
de
bazar
tordus
salis
par
lusage
des
cuvettes
ébréchées
des
peignes
de
corne
édentés
tout
ce
que
la
hâte
et
le
sansgêne
de
deux
femmes
se
déshabillant
se
débarbouillant
en
commun
laissent
autour
delles
de
désordre
dans
un
lieu
où
elles
ne
font
que
passer
et
dont
la
saleté
ne
les
touche
plus
arrivez
donc
répéta
fauchery
avec
cette
camaraderie
des
hommes
chez
les
filles
cest
clarisse
qui
veut
vous
embrasser
muffat
finit
par
entrer
mais
il
resta
surpris
en
trouvant
le
marquis
de
chouard
installé
entre
les
deux
toilettes
sur
une
chaise
le
marquis
sétait
retiré
là
il
écartait
les
pieds
parce
quun
seau
fuyait
et
laissait
couler
une
mare
blanchâtre
le
sentait
à
laise
connaissant
les
bons
endroits
ragaillardi
dans
cet
étouffement
de
baignoire
dans
cette
tranquille
impudeur
de
la
femme
que
ce
coin
de
malpropreté
rendait
naturelle
et
comme
élargie
estce
que
tu
vas
avec
le
vieux
demanda
simonne
à
loreille
de
clarisse
plus
souvent
répondit
celleci
tout
haut
lhabilleuse
une
jeune
fille
très
laide
et
très
familière
en
train
daider
simonne
à
mettre
son
manteau
se
tordit
de
rire
toutes
trois
se
poussaient
balbutiaient
des
mots
qui
redoublaient
leur
gaieté
voyons
clarisse
embrasse
le
monsieur
répéta
fauchery
tu
sais
quil
le
sac
et
se
tournant
vers
le
comte
vous
allez
voir
elle
est
très
gentille
elle
va
vous
embrasser
mais
clarisse
était
dégoûtée
des
hommes
elle
parla
violemment
des
salauds
qui
attendaient
en
bas
chez
la
concierge
dailleurs
elle
était
pressée
de
redescendre
allait
lui
faire
manquer
sa
dernière
scène
puis
comme
fauchery
barrait
la
porte
elle
posa
deux
baisers
sur
les
favoris
de
muffat
en
disant
ce
nest
pas
pour
vous
au
moins
cest
pour
fauchery
qui
membête
et
elle
séchappa
le
comte
demeurait
gêné
devant
son
beaupère
un
flot
de
sang
lui
était
monté
à
la
face
il
navait
pas
éprouvé
dans
la
loge
de
nana
au
milieu
de
ce
luxe
de
tentures
et
de
glaces
lâcre
excitation
de
la
misère
honteuse
de
ce
galetas
plein
de
labandon
des
deux
femmes
cependant
le
marquis
venait
de
partir
derrière
simonne
très
pressée
lui
parlant
dans
le
cou
pendant
quelle
refusait
de
la
tête
fauchery
les
suivait
en
riant
alors
le
comte
se
vit
seul
avec
lhabilleuse
qui
rinçait
les
cuvettes
et
il
sen
alla
il
descendit
à
son
tour
lescalier
les
jambes
molles
levant
de
nouveau
devant
lui
des
femmes
en
jupons
faisant
battre
les
portes
sur
son
passage
mais
au
milieu
de
cette
débandade
de
filles
lâchées
à
travers
les
quatre
étages
il
naperçut
distinctement
quun
chat
le
gros
chat
rouge
qui
dans
cette
fournaise
empoisonnée
de
musc
filait
le
long
des
marches
en
se
frottant
le
dos
contre
les
barreaux
de
la
rampe
la
queue
en
lair
ah
bien
dit
une
voix
enrouée
de
femme
jai
cru
quils
nous
garderaient
ce
soir
en
voilà
des
raseurs
avec
leurs
rappels
cétait
la
fin
le
rideau
venait
de
tomber
il
avait
un
véritable
galop
dans
lescalier
dont
la
cage
semplissait
dexclamations
dune
hâte
brutale
à
se
rhabiller
et
à
partir
comme
le
comte
muffat
descendait
la
dernière
marche
il
aperçut
nana
et
le
prince
qui
suivaient
lentement
le
couloir
la
jeune
femme
sarrêta
puis
souriante
baissant
la
voix
cest
cela
à
tout
à
lheure
le
prince
retourna
sur
la
scène
où
bordenave
lattendait
alors
seul
avec
nana
cédant
à
une
poussée
de
colère
et
de
désir
muffat
courut
derrière
elle
et
au
moment
où
elle
rentrait
dans
sa
loge
il
lui
planta
un
rude
baiser
sur
la
nuque
sur
les
petits
poils
blonds
qui
frisaient
très
bas
entre
ses
épaules
cétait
comme
le
baiser
reçu
en
haut
quil
rendait
là
nana
furieuse
levait
déjà
la
main
quand
elle
reconnut
le
comte
elle
eut
un
sourire
oh
vous
mavez
fait
peur
ditelle
simplement
et
son
sourire
était
adorable
confus
et
soumis
comme
si
elle
eût
désespéré
de
ce
baiser
et
quelle
fût
heureuse
de
lavoir
reçu
mais
elle
ne
pouvait
pas
ni
le
soir
ni
le
lendemain
il
fallait
attendre
si
même
elle
avait
pu
elle
se
serait
fait
désirer
son
regard
disait
ces
choses
enfin
elle
reprit
vous
savez
je
suis
propriétaire
oui
jachète
une
maison
de
campagne
près
dorléans
dans
un
pays
où
vous
allez
quelquefois
bébé
dit
ça
le
petit
georges
hugon
vous
le
connaissez
venez
donc
voir
làbas
le
comte
effrayé
de
sa
brutalité
dhomme
timide
honteux
de
ce
quil
avait
fait
la
salua
cérémonieusement
en
lui
promettant
de
se
rendre
à
son
invitation
puis
il
séloigna
marchant
dans
un
rêve
il
rejoignait
le
prince
lorsque
en
passant
devant
le
foyer
il
entendit
satin
crier
en
voilà
un
vieux
sale
fichezmoi
la
paix
cétait
le
marquis
de
chouard
qui
se
rabattait
sur
satin
celleci
avait
décidément
assez
de
tout
ce
monde
chic
nana
venait
bien
de
la
présenter
à
bordenave
mais
ça
lavait
trop
assommée
de
rester
la
bouche
cousue
par
crainte
de
laisser
échapper
des
bêtises
et
elle
voulait
se
rattraper
dautant
plus
quelle
était
tombée
dans
les
coulisses
sur
un
ancien
à
elle
le
figurant
chargé
du
rôle
de
pluton
un
pâtissier
qui
lui
avait
déjà
donné
toute
une
semaine
damour
et
de
gifles
elle
lattendait
irritée
de
ce
que
le
marquis
lui
parlait
comme
à
une
de
ces
dames
du
théâtre
aussi
finitelle
par
être
très
digne
jetant
cette
phrase
mon
mari
va
venir
vous
allez
voir
cependant
les
artistes
en
paletot
le
visage
las
partaient
un
à
un
des
groupes
dhommes
et
de
femmes
descendaient
le
petit
escalier
tournant
mettaient
dans
lombre
des
profils
de
chapeaux
défoncés
de
châles
fripés
une
laideur
blême
de
cabotins
qui
ont
enlevé
leur
rouge
sur
la
scène
où
lon
éteignait
les
portants
et
les
herses
le
prince
écoutait
une
anecdote
de
bordenave
il
voulait
attendre
nana
quand
celleci
parut
enfin
la
scène
était
noire
le
pompier
de
service
achevant
sa
ronde
promenait
une
lanterne
bordenave
pour
éviter
à
son
altesse
le
détour
du
passage
des
panoramas
venait
de
faire
ouvrir
le
couloir
qui
va
de
la
loge
de
la
concierge
au
vestibule
du
théâtre
et
cétait
le
long
de
cette
allée
un
sauvequipeut
de
petites
femmes
heureuses
déchapper
aux
hommes
en
train
de
poser
dans
le
passage
elles
se
bousculaient
serrant
les
coudes
jetant
des
regards
en
arrière
respirant
seulement
dehors
tandis
que
fontan
bosc
et
prullière
se
retiraient
lentement
en
blaguant
la
tête
des
hommes
sérieux
qui
arpentaient
la
galerie
des
variétés
à
lheure
où
les
petites
filaient
par
le
boulevard
avec
des
amants
de
coeur
mais
clarisse
surtout
fut
maligne
elle
se
méfiait
de
la
faloise
en
effet
il
était
encore
là
dans
la
loge
en
compagnie
des
messieurs
qui
sentêtaient
sur
les
chaises
de
madame
bron
tous
tendaient
le
nez
alors
elle
passa
raide
derrière
une
amie
ces
messieurs
clignaient
les
paupières
ahuris
par
cette
dégringolade
de
jupes
tourbillonnant
au
pied
de
létroit
escalier
désespérés
dattendre
depuis
si
longtemps
pour
les
voir
ainsi
senvoler
toutes
sans
en
reconnaître
une
seule
la
portée
des
chats
noirs
dormait
sur
la
toile
cirée
contre
le
ventre
de
la
mère
béate
et
les
pattes
élargies
pendant
que
le
gros
chat
rouge
assis
à
lautre
bout
de
la
table
la
queue
allongée
regardait
de
ses
yeux
jaunes
les
femmes
se
sauver
si
son
altesse
veut
bien
passer
par
ici
dit
bordenave
au
bas
de
lescalier
en
indiquant
le
couloir
quelques
figurantes
poussaient
encore
le
prince
suivait
nana
muffat
et
le
marquis
venaient
derrière
cétait
un
long
boyau
pris
entre
le
théâtre
et
la
maison
voisine
une
sorte
de
ruelle
étranglée
quon
avait
couverte
dune
toiture
en
pente
où
souvraient
des
châssis
vitrés
une
humidité
suintait
des
murailles
les
pas
sonnaient
sur
le
sol
dallé
comme
dans
un
souterrain
il
avait
là
un
encombrement
de
grenier
un
établi
sur
lequel
le
concierge
donnait
un
coup
de
rabot
aux
décors
un
empilement
de
barrières
de
bois
quon
posait
le
soir
à
la
porte
pour
maintenir
la
queue
nana
dut
relever
sa
robe
en
passant
devant
une
bornefontaine
dont
le
robinet
mal
fermé
inondait
les
dalles
dans
le
vestibule
se
salua
et
quand
bordenave
fut
seul
il
résuma
son
jugement
sur
le
prince
par
un
haussement
dépaules
plein
dune
dédaigneuse
philosophie
il
est
un
peu
mufe
tout
de
même
ditil
sans
sexpliquer
davantage
à
fauchery
que
rose
mignon
emmenait
avec
son
mari
pour
les
réconcilier
chez
elle
muffat
se
trouva
seul
sur
le
trottoir
son
altesse
venait
tranquillement
de
faire
monter
nana
dans
sa
voiture
le
marquis
avait
filé
derrière
satin
et
son
figurant
excité
se
contentant
à
suivre
ces
deux
vices
avec
le
vague
espoir
de
quelque
complaisance
alors
muffat
la
tête
en
feu
voulut
rentrer
à
pied
tout
combat
avait
cessé
en
lui
un
flot
de
vie
nouvelle
noyait
ses
idées
et
ses
croyances
de
quarante
années
pendant
quil
longeait
les
boulevards
le
roulement
des
dernières
voitures
lassourdissait
du
nom
de
nana
les
becs
de
gaz
faisaient
danser
devant
ses
yeux
des
nudités
les
bras
souples
les
épaules
blanches
de
nana
et
il
sentait

renié

pour

le
soir
même
cétait
sa
jeunesse
qui
séveillait
enfin
une
puberté
goulue

brûlant
tout
à
coup
dans
sa
froideur
de
catholique
et
dans
sa
dignité
dhomme
mûr
vi
le
comte
muffat
accompagné
de
sa
femme
et
de
sa
fille
était
arrivé
de
la
veille
aux
fondettes
où
madame
hugon
qui
trouvait
seule
avec
son
fils
georges
les
avait
invités
à
venir
passer
huit
jours
la
maison
bâtie
vers
la
fin
du
dixseptième
siècle
sélevait
au
milieu
dun
immense
enclos
carré
sans
un
ornement
mais
le
jardin
avait
des
ombrages
magnifiques
une
suite
de
bassins
aux
eaux
courantes
alimentés
par
des
sources
cétait
le
long
de
la
route
dorléans
à
paris
comme
un
flot
de
verdure
un
bouquet
darbres
rompant
la
monotonie
de
ce
pays
plat
où
des
cultures
se
déroulaient
à
linfini
onze
heures
lorsque
le
second
coup
de
cloche
pour
le
déjeuner
eut
réuni
tout
le
monde
madame
hugon
avec
son
bon
sourire
maternel
posa
deux
gros
baisers
sur
les
joues
de
sabine
en
disant
tu
sais
à
la
campagne
cest
mon
habitude
ça
rajeunit
de
vingt
ans
de
te
voir
ici
astu
bien
dormi
dans
ton
ancienne
chambre
puis
sans
attendre
la
réponse
se
tournant
vers
estelle
et
cette
petite
n
fait
quun
somme
elle
aussi
embrassemoi
mon
enfant
sétait
assis
dans
la
vaste
salle
à
manger
dont
les
fenêtres
donnaient
sur
le
parc
mais
occupait
un
bout
seulement
de
la
grande
table
où
lon
se
serrait
pour
être
plus
ensemble
sabine
très
gaie
rappelait
ses
souvenirs
de
jeunesse
qui
venaient
dêtre
éveillés
des
mois
passés
aux
fondettes
de
longues
promenades
une
chute
dans
un
bassin
par
un
soir
dété
un
vieux
roman
de
chevalerie
découvert
sur
une
armoire
et
lu
en
hiver
devant
un
feu
de
sarments
et
georges
qui
navait
pas
revu
la
comtesse
depuis
quelques
mois
la
trouvait
drôle
avec
quelque
chose
de
changé
dans
la
figure
tandis
que
cette
perche
destelle
au
contraire
semblait
plus
effacée
encore
muette
et
gauche
comme
mangeait
des
oeufs
à
la
coque
et
des
côtelettes
très
simplement
madame
hugon
se
lamenta
en
femme
de
ménage
racontant
que
les
bouchers
devenaient
impossibles
elle
prenait
tout
à
orléans
ne
lui
apportait
jamais
les
morceaux
quelle
demandait
dailleurs
si
ses
hôtes
mangeaient
mal
cétait
leur
faute
ils
venaient
trop
tard
dans
la
saison

les
arbres
de
la
pelouse
qui
commençaient
à
jaunir
le
temps
était
couvert
une
vapeur
bleuâtre
noyait
les
lointains
dans
une
douceur
et
une
paix
mélancoliques
oh

gai

messieurs

le
café
la
conversation

tombée
sur
paris
et
le
nom
de
steiner
fut
prononcé
ce
nom
arracha
un
léger
cri
à
madame
hugon

ditelle

gros
monsieur
que

un
soir

en
entendant
sa
mère
aborder
ce
sujet
avait
baissé
le
nez
dans
sa
tasse
mais
il
le
releva
et
regarda
le
comte
étonné
de
sa
réponse
pourquoi
mentaitil
si
carrément
de
son
côté
le
comte
ayant
remarqué
le
mouvement
du
jeune
homme
lui
jeta
un
coup
doeil
de
défiance
madame
hugon
continuait
à
donner
des
détails
la
campagne
sappelait
la
mignotte
il
fallait
remonter
la
choue
jusqu
à
gumières
pour
traverser
sur
un
pont
ce
qui
allongeait
le
chemin
de
deux
bons
kilomètres
autrement
se
mouillait
les
pieds
et
risquait
un
plongeon
et
comment
se
nomme
lactrice
demanda
la
comtesse
ah
l
dit
pourtant
murmura
la
vieille
dame
georges
tu
étais
là
ce
matin
quand
le
jardinier
nous
parlé
georges
eut
lair
de
fouiller
sa
mémoire
muffat
attendait
en
faisant
tourner
une
petite
cuiller
entre
ses
doigts
alors
la
comtesse
sadressant
à
ce
dernier
estce
que
monsieur
steiner
nest
pas
avec
cette
chanteuse
des
variétés
cette
nana
nana
cest

ça
une
horreur
cria
madame

qui
se
fâchait
et
lattend
à
la
mignotte

je
sais
tout
par
le
jardinier
nestce
pas
georges
le
jardinier
disait
quon
lattendait
ce
soir
le
comte
eut
un
léger
tressaillement
de
surprise
mais
georges
répondait
avec
vivacité
oh
maman
le
jardinier
parlait
sans
savoir
tout
à
lheure
le
cocher
disait
le
contraire
nattend
personne
à
la
mignotte
avant
aprèsdemain
il
tâchait
de
prendre
un
air
naturel
en
étudiant
du
coin
de
loeil
leffet
de
ses
paroles
sur
le
comte
celuici
tournait
de
nouveau
sa
petite
cuiller
comme
rassuré
la
comtesse
les
yeux
perdus
sur
les
lointains
bleuâtres
du
parc
semblait
nêtre
plus
à
la
conversation
suivant
avec
lombre
dun
sourire
une
pensée
secrète
éveillée
subitement
en
elle
tandis
que
raide
sur
sa
chaise
estelle
avait
écouté
ce
quon
disait
de
nana
sans
quun
trait
de
son
blanc
visage
de
vierge
eût
bougé
mon
dieu
murmura
après
un
silence
madame
hugon
retrouvant
sa
bonhomie
jai
tort
de
fâcher
il
faut
bien
que
tout
le
monde
vive
si
nous
rencontrons
cette
dame
sur
la
route
nous
en
serons
quittes
pour
ne
pas
la
saluer
et
comme
quittait
la
table
elle
gronda
encore
la
comtesse
sabine
de
sêtre
tant
fait
désirer
cette
annéelà
mais
la
comtesse
se
défendait
rejetait
leurs
retards
sur
son
mari
deux
fois
à
la
veille
de
partir
les
malles
fermées
il
avait
donné
contreordre
en
parlant
daffaires
urgentes
puis
il
sétait
décidé
tout
dun
coup
au
moment
où
le
voyage
semblait
enterré
alors
la
vieille
dame
raconta
que
georges
lui
avait
de
même
annoncé
son
arrivée
à
deux
reprises
sans
paraître
et
quil
était
tombé
lavantveille
aux
fondettes
lorsquelle
ne
comptait
plus
sur
lui
venait
de
descendre
au
jardin
les
deux
hommes
à
droite
et
à
gauche
de
ces
dames
les
écoutaient
silencieux
faisant
le
gros
dos
nimporte
dit
madame
hugon
en
mettant
des
baisers
sur
les
cheveux
blonds
de
son
fils
zizi
est
bien
gentil
dêtre
venu
senfermer
à
la
campagne
avec
sa
mère
ce
bon
zizi
il
ne
moublie
pas
laprèsmidi
elle
éprouva
une
inquiétude
georges
qui
tout
de
suite
au
sortir
de
table
sétait
plaint
dune
lourdeur
de
tête
parut
peu
à
peu
envahi
par
une
migraine
atroce
vers
quatre
heures
il
voulut
monter
se
coucher
cétait
le
seul
remède
quand
il
aurait
dormi
jusquau
lendemain
il
se
porterait
parfaitement
sa
mère
tint
à
le
mettre
au
lit
ellemême
mais
comme
elle
sortait
il
sauta
donner
un
tour
à
la
serrure
il
prétexta
quil
senfermait
pour
quon
ne
vînt
pas
le
déranger
et
il
criait
bonsoir
à
demain
petite
mère
dune
voix
de
caresse
tout
en
promettant
de
ne
faire
quun
somme
il
ne
se
recoucha
pas
le
teint
clair
les
yeux
vifs
se
rhabillant
sans
bruit
puis
attendant
immobile
sur
une
chaise
quand
sonna
le
dîner
il
guetta
le
comte
muffat
qui
se
dirigeait
vers
le
salon
dix
minutes
plus
tard
certain
de
nêtre
pas
vu

fila
lestement
par

saidant
dun
tuyau
de

chambre
située
au
premier
étage

sur
le
derrière
de

dans
un
massif

sortit
du
parc
et
galopa
à

champs
du
côté
de
la
choue

ventre
vide

coeur
sautant

une
petite
pluie

dans
sa
cervelle

bouscula
zoé
pour
les
malles

poussa
dans
un
fiacre
où
très
attendrie
elle
lui
demanda
pardon
en
lembrassant
ce
fut
seulement
au
buffet
de
la
gare
quelle
songea
à
prévenir
steiner
par
une
lettre
elle
le
priait
dattendre
le
surlendemain
pour
la
rejoindre
sil
voulait
la
retrouver
bien
fraîche
et
sautant
à
un
autre
projet
elle
fit
une
seconde
lettre
où
elle
suppliait
sa
tante
damener
immédiatement
le
petit
louis

ferait
tant
de
bien
à
bébé
et
comme
samuserait
ensemble
sous
les
arbres
de
paris
à
orléans
en
wagon
elle
ne
parla
que
de
ça
les
yeux
humides
mêlant
les
fleurs
les
oiseaux
et
son
enfant
dans
une
soudaine
crise
de
maternité
la
mignotte
se
trouvait
à
plus
de
trois
lieues
nana
perdit
une
heure
pour
louer
une
voiture
une
immense
calèche
délabrée
qui
roulait
lentement
avec
un
bruit
de
ferraille
elle
sétait
tout
de
suite
emparée
du
cocher
un
petit
vieux
taciturne
quelle
accablait
de
questions
estce
quil
avait
souvent
passé
devant
la
mignotte
alors
cétait
derrière
ce
coteau
ça
devait
être
plein
darbres
nestce
pas
et
la
maison
se
voyaitelle
de
loin
le
petit
vieux
répondait
par
des
grognements
dans
la
calèche
nana
dansait
dimpatience
tandis
que
zoé
fâchée
davoir
quitté
paris
si
vite
se
tenait
raide
et
maussade
le
cheval
sétant
arrêté
court
la
jeune
femme
crut
quon
arrivait
elle
passa
la
tête
par
la
portière
elle
demanda
hein
nous
sommes
pour
toute
réponse
le
cocher
avait
fouetté
le
cheval
qui
monta
péniblement
une
côte
nana
contemplait
avec
ravissement
la
plaine
immense
sous
le
ciel
gris
où
de
gros
nuages
samoncelaient
oh
regarde
donc
zoé
en
voilà
de
lherbe
estce
que
cest
du
blé
tout
ça
mon
dieu

par
dire
la
bonne
dun
air
pincé

lai
trop
connue
la
campagne
quand

chez
mon
dentiste
qui

une
maison
à
bougival
avec
ça

fait
froid
ce
soir
cest
humide
par
ici
passait
sous
des
arbres
nana
flairait
lodeur
des
feuilles
comme
un
jeune
chien
brusquement
à
un
détour
de
la
route
elle
aperçut
le
coin
dune
habitation
dans
les
branches
cétait
peutêtre
là
et
elle
entama
une
conversation
avec
le
cocher
qui
disait
toujours
non
dun
branlement
de
tête
puis
comme
descendait
lautre
pente
du
coteau
il
se
contenta
dallonger
son
fouet
en
murmurant
tenez
làbas
elle
se
leva
passa
le
corps
entier
par
la
portière
où
donc
où
donc
criaitelle
pâle
ne
voyant
rien
encore
enfin
elle
distingua
un
bout
de
mur
alors
ce
furent
de
petits
cris
de
petits
sauts
tout
un
emportement
de
femme
débordée
par
une
émotion
vive
zoé
je
vois

de
lautre
côté
oh

sur

très
vaste
oh

contente
regarde

donc
la
voiture
sétait
arrêtée
devant
la
grille
une
petite
porte
souvrit
et
le
jardinier
un
grand
sec
parut
sa
casquette
à
la
main
nana
voulut
retrouver
sa
dignité
car
le
cocher
déjà
semblait
rire
en
dedans
avec
ses
lèvres
cousues
elle
se
retint
pour
ne
pas
courir
écouta
le
jardinier
très
bavard
celuilà
qui
priait
madame
dexcuser
le
désordre
attendu
quil
avait
seulement
reçu
la
lettre
de
madame
le
matin
mais
malgré
ses
efforts
elle
était
enlevée
de
terre
elle
marchait
si
vite
que
zoé
ne
pouvait
la
suivre
au
bout
de
lallée
elle
sarrêta
un
instant
pour
embrasser
la
maison
dun
coup
doeil
cétait
un
grand
pavillon
de
style
italien
flanqué
dune
autre
construction
plus
petite
quun
riche
anglais
avait
fait
bâtir
après
deux
ans
de
séjour
à
naples
et
dont
il
sétait
dégoûté
tout
de
suite
je
vais
faire
visiter
à
madame
dit
le
jardinier
mais
elle
lavait
devancé
elle
lui
criait
de
ne
pas
se
déranger
quelle
visiterait
ellemême
quelle
aimait
mieux
ça
et
sans
ôter
son
chapeau
elle
se
lança
dans
les
pièces
appelant
zoé
lui
jetant
des
réflexions
dun
bout
à
lautre
des
couloirs
emplissant
de
ses
cris
et
de
ses
rires
le
vide
de
cette
maison
inhabitée
depuis
de
longs
mois
dabord
le
vestibule
un
peu
humide
mais
ça
ne
faisait
rien

couchait
pas
très
chic
le
salon
avec
ses
fenêtres
ouvertes
sur
une
pelouse
seulement
le
meuble
rouge
était
affreux
elle
changerait
ça
quant
à
la
salle
à
manger

la
belle
salle
à
manger
et
quelles
noces
donnerait
à
paris
si
lon

une
salle
à
manger
de
cette
taille
comme
elle
montait
au
premier
étage
elle
se
souvint
quelle
navait
pas
vu
la
cuisine
elle
redescendit
en
sexclamant
zoé
dut
sémerveiller
sur
la
beauté
de
lévier
et
sur
la
grandeur
de
lâtre
où
lon
aurait
fait
rôtir
un
mouton
lorsquelle
fut
remontée
sa
chambre
surtout
lenthousiasma
une
chambre
quun
tapissier
dorléans
avait
tendue
de
cretonne
louis

joliment

làdedans
un
vrai

ensuite
quatre

puis
des
greniers
magnifiques

très
commode
pour
les
malles
zoé
rechignant
jetant
un
coup
doeil
froid
dans
chaque
pièce
sattardait
derrière
madame
elle
la
regarda
disparaître
en
haut
de
léchelle
raide
des
greniers
merci
elle
navait
pas
envie
de
se
casser
les
jambes
mais
une
voix
lui
arriva
lointaine
comme
soufflée
dans
un
tuyau
de
cheminée

où

madame
sur
le
toit
sappuyant
à
la
rampe
de
briques
regardant
le
vallon
qui
sélargissait
au
loin

immense
mais
des
vapeurs
grises
le
noyaient
un
vent
terrible
chassait
de
fines
gouttes
de
pluie
nana
devait
tenir
son
chapeau
à
deux
mains
pour
quil
ne
fût
pas
enlevé
tandis
que
ses
jupes
flottaient
avec
des
claquements
de
drapeau
ah
non
par
exemple
dit
zoé
en
retirant
tout
de
suite
son
nez
madame
va
être
emportée
quel
chien
de
temps
madame
nentendait
pas
la
tête
penchée
elle
regardait
la
propriété
audessous
delle
il
avait
sept
ou
huit
arpents
enclos
de
murs
alors
la
vue
du
potager
la
prit
tout
entière
elle
se
précipita
bouscula
la
femme
de
chambre
dans
lescalier
en
bégayant
cest
plein
de
choux
oh
des
choux
gros
comme
ça
et
des
salades
de
loseille
des
oignons
et
de
tout
viens
vite
la
pluie
tombait
plus
fort
elle
ouvrit
son
ombrelle
de
soie
blanche
courut
dans
les
allées
madame
va
prendre
du
mal
criait
zoé
restée
tranquillement
sous
la
marquise
du
perron
mais
madame
voulait
voir
chaque
nouvelle
découverte
cétaient
des
exclamations
zoé
des
épinards
viens
donc
oh
des
artichauts
ils
sont
drôles
ça
fleurit
donc
les
artichauts
tiens
questce
que
cest
que
ça
je
ne
connais
pas
ça
viens
donc
zoé
tu
sais
peutêtre
la
femme
de
chambre
ne
bougeait
pas
il
fallait
vraiment
que
madame
fût
enragée
maintenant
leau
tombait
à
torrents
la
petite
ombrelle
de
soie
blanche
était
déjà
toute
noire
et
elle
ne
couvrait
pas
madame
dont
la
jupe
ruisselait
cela
ne
la
dérangeait
guère
elle
visitait
sous
laverse
le
potager
et
le
fruitier
sarrêtant
à
chaque
arbre
se
penchant
sur
chaque
planche
de
légumes
puis
elle
courut
jeter
un
coup
doeil
au
fond
du
puits
souleva
un
châssis
pour
regarder
ce
quil
avait
dessous
sabsorba
dans
la
contemplation
dune
énorme
citrouille
son
besoin
était
de
suivre
toutes
les
allées
de
prendre
une
possession
immédiate
de
ces
choses
dont
elle
avait
rêvé
autrefois
quand
elle
traînait
ses
savates
douvrière
sur
le
pavé
de
paris
la
pluie
redoublait
elle
ne
la
sentait
pas
désolée
seulement
de
ce
que
le
jour
tombait
elle
ne
voyait
plus
clair
elle
touchait
avec
les
doigts
pour
se
rendre
compte
tout
à
coup
dans
le
crépuscule
elle
distingua
des
fraises
alors
son
enfance
éclata
des
fraises
des
fraises
il
en
je
les
sens
zoé
une
assiette
viens
cueillir
des
fraises
et
nana
qui
sétait
accroupie
dans
la
boue
lâcha
son
ombrelle
recevant
londée
elle
cueillait
des
fraises
les
mains
trempées
parmi
les
feuilles
cependant
zoé
napportait
pas
dassiette
comme
la
jeune
femme
se
relevait
elle
fut
prise
de
peur
il
lui
avait
semblé
voir
glisser
une
ombre
une
bête
criatelle
mais
la
stupeur
la
planta
au
milieu
de
lallée
cétait
un
homme
et
elle
lavait
reconnu
comment
cest
bébé
questce
que
tu
fais
là
bébé
tiens
pardi
répondit
georges
je
suis
venu
elle
restait
étourdie
tu
savais
donc
mon
arrivée
par
le
jardinier
oh
cet
enfant
et
il
est
trempé
ah
je
vais
te
dire
la
pluie
pris
en
chemin
et
puis
je
nai
pas
voulu
remonter
jusqu
à
gumières
et
en
traversant
la
choue
je
suis
tombé
dans
un
sacré
trou
deau
du
coup
nana
oublia
les
fraises
elle
était
toute
tremblante
et
apitoyée
ce
pauvre
zizi
dans
un
trou
deau
elle
lentraînait
vers
la
maison
elle
parlait
de
faire
un
grand
feu
tu
sais
murmuratil
en
larrêtant
dans
lombre
je
cachais
parce
que
javais
peur
dêtre
grondé
comme
à
paris
quand
je
vais
te
voir
sans
être
attendu
elle
se
mit
à
rire
sans
répondre
et
lui
posa
un
baiser
sur
le
front
jusqu
à
ce
jour
elle
lavait
traité
en
gamin
ne
prenant
pas
ses
déclarations
au
sérieux
samusant
de
lui
comme
dun
petit
homme
sans
conséquence
ce
fut
une
affaire
pour
linstaller
elle
voulut
absolument
quon
allumât
le
feu
dans
sa
chambre
serait
mieux
là
la
vue
de
georges
navait
pas
surpris
zoé
habituée
à
toutes
les
rencontres
mais
le
jardinier
qui
montait
le
bois
resta
interloqué
en
apercevant
ce
monsieur
ruisselant
deau
auquel
il
était
certain
de
ne
pas
avoir
ouvert
la
porte
le
renvoya
navait
plus
besoin
de
lui
une
lampe
éclairait
la
pièce
le
feu
jetait
une
grande
flamme
claire
jamais
il
ne
séchera
il
va
senrhumer
dit
nana
en
voyant
georges
pris
dun
frisson
et
pas
un
pantalon
dhomme
elle
était
sur
le
point
de
rappeler
le
jardinier
lorsquelle
eut
une
idée
zoé
qui
défaisait
les
malles
dans
le
cabinet
de
toilette
apportait
à
madame
du
linge
pour
se
changer
une
chemise
des
jupons
un
peignoir
mais
cest
parfait
cria
la
jeune
femme
zizi
peut
mettre
tout
ça
hein
tu
nes
pas
dégoûté
de
moi
quand
tes
vêtements
seront
secs
tu
les
reprendras
et
tu
ten
iras
vite
pour
ne
pas
être
grondé
par
ta
maman
dépêchetoi
je
vais
changer
aussi
dans
le
cabinet
lorsque
dix
minutes
plus
tard
elle
reparut
en
robe
de
chambre
elle
joignit
les
mains
de
ravissement
oh
le
mignon
quil
est
gentil
en
petite
femme
il
avait
simplement
passé
une
grande
chemise
de
nuit
à
entredeux
un
pantalon
brodé
et
le
peignoir
un
long
peignoir
de
batiste
garni
de
dentelles
làdedans
il
semblait
une
fille
avec
ses
deux
bras
nus
de
jeune
blond
avec
ses
cheveux
fauves
encore
mouillés
qui
roulaient
dans
son
cou
cest
quil
est
aussi
mince
que
moi
dit
nana
en
le
prenant
par
la
taille
zoé
viens
donc
voir
comme
ça
lui
va
hein
cest
fait
pour
lui
à
part
le
corsage
qui
est
trop
large
il
nen
pas
autant
que
moi
ce
pauvre
zizi
ah
bien
sûr
ça
manque
un
peu
murmura
georges
souriant
tous
trois
ségayèrent
nana
sétait
mise
à
boutonner
le
peignoir
du
haut
en
bas
pour
quil
fût
décent
elle
le
tournait
comme
une
poupée
donnait
des
tapes
faisait
bouffer
la
jupe
parderrière
et
elle
le
questionnait
lui
demandant
sil
était
bien
sil
avait
chaud
par
exemple
oui
il
était
bien
rien
ne
tenait
plus
chaud
quune
chemise
de
femme
sil
avait
pu
il
en
aurait
toujours
porté
il
se
roulait
làdedans
heureux
de
la
finesse
du
linge
de
ce
vêtement
lâche
qui
sentait
bon
et
où
il
croyait
retrouver
un
peu
de
la
vie
tiède
de
nana
cependant
zoé
venait
de
descendre
les
habits
trempés
à
la
cuisine
afin
de
les
faire
sécher
le
plus
vite
possible
devant
un
feu
de
sarments
alors
georges
allongé
dans
un
fauteuil
osa
faire
un
aveu
dis
donc
tu
ne
manges
pas
ce
soir
moi
je
meurs
de
faim
je
nai
pas
dîné
nana
se
fâcha
en
voilà
une
grosse
bête
de
filer
de
chez
sa
maman
le
ventre
vide
pour
aller
se
flanquer
dans
un
trou
deau
mais
elle
aussi
avait
lestomac
en
bas
des
talons
bien
sûr
quil
fallait
manger
seulement
mangerait
ce
quon
pourrait
et
improvisa
sur
un
guéridon
roulé
devant
le
feu
le
dîner
le
plus
drôle
zoé
courut
chez
le
jardinier
qui
avait
fait
une
soupe
aux
choux
en
cas
que
madame
ne
dînât
pas
à
orléans
avant
de
venir
madame
avait
oublié
de
lui
marquer
sur
sa
lettre
ce
quil
devait
préparer
heureusement
la
cave
était
bien
garnie
eut
donc
une
soupe
aux
choux
avec
un
morceau
de
lard
puis
en
fouillant
dans
son
sac
nana
trouva
un
tas
de
choses
des
provisions
quelle
avait
fourrées
là
par
précaution
un
petit
pâté
de
foie
gras
un
sac
de
bonbons
des
oranges
tous
deux
mangèrent
comme
des
ogres
avec
un
appétit
de
vingt
ans
en
camarades
qui
ne
se
gênaient
pas
nana
appelait
georges
chère
ça
lui
semblait
plus
familier
et
plus
tendre
au
dessert
pour
ne
pas
déranger
zoé
ils
vidèrent
avec
la
même
cuiller
chacun
à
son
tour
un
pot
de
confiture
trouvé
en
haut
dune
armoire
ah
chère
dit
nana
en
repoussant
le
guéridon
il
dix
ans
que
je
nai
dîné
si
bien
pourtant
il
se
faisait
tard
elle
voulait
renvoyer
le
petit
par
crainte
de
lui
attirer
de
mauvaises
raisons
lui
répétait
quil
avait
le
temps
dailleurs
les
vêtements
séchaient
mal
zoé
déclarait
quil
faudrait
au
moins
une
heure
encore
et
comme
elle
dormait
debout
fatiguée
du
voyage
ils
lenvoyèrent
se
coucher
alors
ils
restèrent
seuls
dans
la
maison
muette
ce
fut
une
soirée
très
douce
le
feu
se
mourait
en
braise
étouffait
un
peu
dans
la
grande
chambre
bleue
où
zoé
avait
fait
le
lit
avant
de
monter
nana
prise
par
la
grosse
chaleur
se
leva
pour
ouvrir
un
instant
la
fenêtre
mais
elle
poussa
un
léger
cri
mon
dieu
que
cest
beau
regarde
chère
georges
était
venu
et
comme
si
la
barre
dappui
lui
eût
paru
trop
courte
il
prit
nana
par
la
taille
il
appuya
la
tête
à
son
épaule
le
temps
avait
brusquement
changé
un
ciel
pur
se
creusait
tandis
quune
lune
ronde
éclairait
la
campagne
dune
nappe
dor
cétait
une
paix
souveraine
un
élargissement
du
vallon
souvrant
sur
limmensité
de
la
plaine
où
les
arbres
faisaient
des
îlots
dombre
dans
le
lac
immobile
des
clartés
et
nana
sattendrissait
se
sentait
redevenir
petite
pour
sûr
elle
avait
rêvé
des
nuits
pareilles
à
une
époque
de
sa
vie
quelle
ne
se
rappelait
plus
tout
ce
qui
lui
arrivait
depuis
sa
descente
de
wagon
cette
campagne
si
grande
ces
herbes
qui
sentaient
fort
cette
maison
ces
légumes
tout
ça
la
bouleversait
au
point
quelle
croyait
avoir
quitté
paris
depuis
vingt
ans
son
existence
dhier
était
loin
elle
éprouvait
des
choses
quelle
ne
savait
pas
georges
cependant
lui
mettait
sur
le
cou
de
petits
baisers
câlins
ce
qui
augmentait
son
trouble
dune
main
hésitante
elle
le
repoussait
comme
un
enfant
dont
la
tendresse
fatigue
et
elle
répétait
quil
fallait
partir
lui
ne
disait
pas
non
tout
à
lheure
il
partirait
tout
à
lheure
mais
un
oiseau
chanta
puis
se
tut
cétait
un
rougegorge
dans
un
sureau
sous
la
fenêtre
attends
murmura
georges
la
lampe
lui
fait
peur
je
vais
léteindre
et
quand
il
vint
la
reprendre
à
la
taille
il
ajouta
nous
la
rallumerons
dans
un
instant
alors
en
écoutant
le
rougegorge
tandis
que
le
petit
se
serrait
contre
elle
nana
se
souvint
oui
cétait
dans
des
romances
quelle
avait
vu
tout
ça
autrefois
elle
eût
donné
son
coeur
pour
avoir
la
lune
ainsi
et
des
rougesgorges
et
un
petit
homme
plein
damour
mon
dieu
elle
aurait
pleuré
tant
ça
lui
paraissait
bon
et
gentil
bien
sûr
quelle
était
née
pour
vivre
sage
elle
repoussait
georges
qui
senhardissait
non
laissemoi
je
ne
veux
pas
ce
serait
très
vilain
à
ton
âge
écoute
je
resterai
ta
maman
des
pudeurs
lui
venaient
elle
était
toute
rouge
personne
ne
pouvait
la
voir
pourtant
la
chambre
semplissait
de
nuit
derrière
eux
tandis
que
la
campagne
déroulait
le
silence
et
limmobilité
de
sa
solitude
jamais
elle
navait
eu
une
pareille
honte
peu
à
peu
elle
se
sentait
sans
force
malgré
sa
gêne
et
ses
révoltes
ce
déguisement
cette
chemise
de
femme
et
ce
peignoir
la
faisaient
rire
encore
cétait
comme
une
amie
qui
la
taquinait
oh
cest
mal
cest
mal
balbutiatelle
après
un
dernier
effort
et
elle
tomba
en
vierge
dans
les
bras
de
cet
enfant
en
face
de
la
belle
nuit
la
maison
dormait
le
lendemain
aux
fondettes
quand
la
cloche
sonna
le
déjeuner
la
table
de
la
salle
à
manger
nétait
plus
trop
grande
une
première
voiture
avait
amené
ensemble
fauchery
et
daguenet
et
derrière
eux
débarqué
du
train
suivant
venait
darriver
le
comte
de
vandeuvres
georges
descendit
le
dernier
un
peu
pâle
les
yeux
battus
il
répondait
que
ça
allait
beaucoup
mieux
mais
quil
était
encore
étourdi
par
la
violence
de
la
crise
madame
hugon
qui
le
regardait
dans
les
yeux
avec
un
sourire
inquiet
ramenait
ses
cheveux
mal
peignés
ce
matinlà
pendant
quil
se
reculait
comme
gêné
de
cette
caresse
table
elle
plaisanta
affectueusement
vandeuvres
quelle
disait
attendre
depuis
cinq
ans
enfin
vous
voilà
comment
avezvous
fait
vandeuvres
le
prit
sur
un
ton
plaisant
il
racontait
quil
avait
perdu
un
argent
fou
la
veille
au
cercle
alors
il
était
parti
avec
lidée
de
faire
une
fin
en
province
foi
oui
si
vous
trouvez
une
héritière
dans
la
contrée
il
doit
avoir
ici
des
femmes
délicieuses
la
vieille
dame
remerciait
également
daguenet
et
fauchery
davoir
bien
voulu
accepter
linvitation
de
son
fils
lorsquelle
éprouva
une
joyeuse
surprise
en
voyant
entrer
le
marquis
de
chouard
quune
troisième
voiture
amenait
ah
ça
sécriatelle
cest
donc
un
rendezvous
ce
matin
vous
vous
êtes
donné
le
mot
que
se
passetil
voilà
des
années
que
je
nai
pu
vous
réunir
et
vous
tombez
tous
à
la
fois
oh
je
ne
plains
pas
ajouta
un
couvert
fauchery
se
trouvait
près
de
la
comtesse
sabine
qui
le
surprenait
par
sa
gaieté
vive
elle
quil
avait
vue
si
languissante
dans
le
salon
sévère
de
la
rue
miromesnil
daguenet
assis
à
la
gauche
destelle
paraissait
au
contraire
inquiet
du
voisinage
de
cette
grande
fille
muette
dont
les
coudes
pointus
lui
étaient
désagréables
muffat
et
chouard
avaient
échangé
un
regard
sournois
cependant
vandeuvres
poussait
la
plaisanterie
de
son
prochain
mariage
propos
de
dame
finit
par
lui
dire
madame
hugon
jai
une
nouvelle
voisine
que
vous
devez
connaître
et
elle
nomma
nana
vandeuvres
affecta
le
plus
vif
étonnement
comment
la
propriété
de
nana
est
près
dici
fauchery
et
daguenet
également
se
récrièrent
le
marquis
de
chouard
mangeait
un
blanc
de
volaille
sans
paraître
comprendre
pas
un
des
hommes
navait
eu
un
sourire
sans
doute
reprit
la
vieille
dame
et
même
cette
personne
est
arrivée
hier
soir
à
la
mignotte
comme
je
le
disais
jai
appris
ça
ce
matin
par
le
jardinier
du
coup
ces
messieurs
ne
purent
cacher
une
très
réelle
surprise
tous
levèrent
la
tête
eh
quoi
nana
était
arrivée
mais
ils
ne
lattendaient
que
le
lendemain
ils
croyaient
la
devancer
seul
georges
resta
les
cils
baissés
regardant
son
verre
dun
air
las
depuis
le
commencement
du
déjeuner
il
semblait
dormir
les
yeux
ouverts
vaguement
souriant
estce
que
tu
souffres
toujours
mon
zizi
lui
demanda
sa
mère
dont
le
regard
ne
le
quittait
pas
il
tressaillit
il
répondit
en
rougissant
que
ça
allait
tout
à
fait
bien
et
il
gardait
sa
mine
noyée
et
gourmande
encore
de
fille
qui
trop
dansé
quastu
donc
là
au
cou
reprit
madame
hugon
effrayée
cest
tout
rouge
il
se
troubla
et
balbutia
il
ne
savait
pas
il
navait
rien
au
cou
puis
remontant
son
col
de
chemise
ah
oui
cest
une
bête
qui
piqué
le
marquis
de
chouard
avait
jeté
un
coup
doeil
oblique
sur
la
petite
rougeur
muffat
lui
aussi
regarda
georges
achevait
de
déjeuner
en
réglant
des
projets
dexcursion
fauchery
était
de
plus
en
plus
remué
par
les
rires
de
la
comtesse
sabine
comme
il
lui
passait
une
assiette
de
fruits
leurs
mains
se
touchèrent
et
elle
le
regarda
une
seconde
dun
regard
si
noir
quil
pensa
de
nouveau
à
cette
confidence
reçue
un
soir
divresse
puis
elle
nétait
plus
la
même
quelque
chose
saccusait
davantage
en
elle
sa
robe
de
foulard
gris
molle
à
ses
épaules
mettait
un
abandon
dans
son
élégance
fine
et
nerveuse
au
sortir
de
table
daguenet
resta
en
arrière
avec
fauchery
pour
plaisanter
crûment
sur
estelle
un
joli
balai
à
coller
dans
les
bras
dun
homme
pourtant
il
devint
sérieux
lorsque
le
journaliste
lui
eut
dit
le
chiffre
de
la
dot
quatre
cent
mille
francs
et
la
mère
demanda
fauchery
hein
très
chic
oh
cellelà
tant
quelle
voudrait
mais
pas
moyen
mon
bon
bah
estce
quon
sait
il
faudrait
voir
ne
devait
pas
sortir
ce
jourlà
la
pluie
tombait
encore
par
averses
georges
sétait
hâté
de
disparaître
enfermé
à
double
tour
dans
sa
chambre
ces
messieurs
évitèrent
de
sexpliquer
entre
eux
tout
en
nétant
pas
dupes
des
raisons
qui
les
réunissaient
vandeuvres
très
maltraité
par
le
jeu
avait
eu
réellement
lidée
de
se
mettre
au
vert
et
il
comptait
sur
le
voisinage
dune
amie
pour
lempêcher
de
trop
sennuyer
fauchery
profitant
des
vacances
que
lui
donnait
rose
alors
très
occupée
se
proposait
de
traiter
dune
seconde
chronique
avec
nana
dans
le
cas
où
la
campagne
les
attendrirait
tous
les
deux
daguenet
qui
la
boudait
depuis
steiner
songeait
à
renouer
à
ramasser
quelques
douceurs
si
loccasion
se
présentait
quant
au
marquis
de
chouard
il
guettait
son
heure
mais
parmi
ces
hommes
suivant
à
la
trace
vénus
mal
débarbouillée
de
son
rouge
muffat
était
le
plus
ardent
le
plus
tourmenté
par
des
sensations
nouvelles
de
désir
de
peur
et
de
colère
qui
se
battaient
dans
son
être
bouleversé
lui
avait
une
promesse
formelle
nana
lattendait
pourquoi
donc
étaitelle
partie
deux
jours
plus
tôt
il
résolut
de
se
rendre
à
la
mignotte
le
soir
même
après
le
dîner
le
soir
comme
le
comte
sortait
du
parc
georges
senfuit
derrière
lui
il
le
laissa
suivre
la
route
de
gumières
traversa
la
choue
tomba
chez
nana
essoufflé
enragé
avec
des
larmes
plein
les
yeux
ah
il
avait
bien
compris
ce
vieux
qui
était
en
route
venait
pour
un
rendezvous
nana
stupéfaite
de
cette
scène
de
jalousie
toute
remuée
de
voir
comment
tournaient
les
choses
le
prit
dans
ses
bras
le
consola
du
mieux
quelle
put
mais
non
il
se
trompait
elle
nattendait
personne
si
le
monsieur
venait
ce
nétait
pas
sa
faute
ce
zizi
quelle
grosse
bête
de
se
causer
tant
de
bile
pour
rien
sur
la
tête
de
son
enfant
elle
naimait
que
son
georges
et
elle
le
baisait
et
elle
essuyait
ses
larmes
écoute
tu
vas
voir
que
tout
est
pour
toi
repritelle
quand
il
fut
plus
calme
steiner
est
arrivé
il
est
làhaut
celuilà
mon
chéri
tu
sais
que
je
ne
puis
pas
le
mettre
à
la
porte
oui
je
sais
je
ne
parle
pas
de
celuilà
murmura
le
petit
eh
bien
je
lai
collé
dans
la
chambre
du
fond
en
lui
racontant
que
je
suis
malade
il
défait
sa
malle
puisque
personne
ne
aperçu
monte
vite
te
cacher
dans
chambre
et
attendsmoi
georges
lui
sauta
au
cou
cétait
donc
vrai
elle
laimait
un
peu
alors
comme
hier
ils
éteindraient
la
lampe
ils
resteraient
dans
le
noir
jusquau
jour
puis
à
un
coup
de
sonnette
il
fila
légèrement
en
haut
dans
la
chambre
il
enleva
tout
de
suite
ses
souliers
pour
ne
pas
faire
de
bruit
puis
il
se
cacha
par
terre
derrière
un
rideau
attendant
dun
air
sage
nana
reçut
le
comte
muffat
encore
secouée
prise
dune
certaine
gêne
elle
lui
avait
promis
elle
aurait
même
voulu
tenir
sa
parole
parce
que
cet
homme
lui
semblait
sérieux
mais
en
vérité
qui
se
serait
douté
des
histoires
de
la
veille
ce
voyage
cette
maison
quelle
ne
connaissait
pas
ce
petit
qui
arrivait
tout
mouillé
et
comme
ça
lui
avait
paru
bon
et
comme
ce
serait
gentil
de
continuer
tant
pis
pour
le
monsieur
depuis
trois
mois
elle
le
faisait
poser
jouant
à
la
femme
comme
il
faut
afin
de
lallumer
davantage
eh
bien
il
poserait
encore
il
sen
irait
si
ça
ne
lui
plaisait
pas
elle
aurait
plutôt
tout
lâché
que
de
tromper
georges
le
comte
sétait
assis
de
lair
cérémonieux
dun
voisin
de
campagne
en
visite
ses
mains
seules
avaient
un
tremblement
dans
cette
nature
sanguine
restée
vierge
le
désir
fouetté
par
la
savante
tactique
de
nana
déterminait
à
la
longue
de
terribles
ravages
cet
homme
si
grave
ce
chambellan
qui
traversait
dun
pas
digne
les
salons
des
tuileries
mordait
la
nuit
son
traversin
et
sanglotait
exaspéré
évoquant
toujours
la
même
image
sensuelle
mais
cette
fois
il
était
résolu
den
finir
le
long
de
la
route
dans
la
grande
paix
du
crépuscule
il
avait
rêvé
des
brutalités
et
tout
de
suite
après
les
premières
paroles
il
voulut
saisir
nana
à
deux
mains
non
non
prenez
garde
ditelle
simplement
sans
se
fâcher
avec
un
sourire
il
la
rattrapa
les
dents
serrées
puis
comme
elle
se
débattait
il
fut
grossier
il
lui
rappela
crûment
quil
venait
coucher
elle
toujours
souriante
embarrassée
pourtant
lui
tenait
les
mains
elle
le
tutoya
afin
dadoucir
son
refus
voyons
chéri
tienstoi
tranquille
vrai
je
ne
peux
pas
steiner
est
làhaut
mais
il
était
fou
jamais
elle
navait
vu
un
homme
dans
un
état
pareil
la
peur
la
prenait
elle
lui
mit
les
doigts
sur
la
bouche
pour
étouffer
les
cris
quil
laissait
échapper
et
baissant
la
voix
elle
le
suppliait
de
se
taire
de
la
lâcher
steiner
descendait
cétait
stupide
à
la
fin
quand
steiner
entra
il
entendit
nana
mollement
allongée
au
fond
de
son
fauteuil
qui
disait
moi
jadore
la
campagne
elle
tourna
la
tête
sinterrompant
chéri
cest
monsieur
le
comte
muffat
qui
vu
de
la
lumière
en
se
promenant
et
qui
est
entré
nous
souhaiter
la
bienvenue
les
deux
hommes
se
serrèrent
la
main
muffat
demeura
un
instant
sans
parler
la
face
dans
lombre
steiner
paraissait
maussade
causa
de
paris
les
affaires
ne
marchaient
pas
il
avait
eu
à
la
bourse
des
abominations
au
bout
dun
quart
dheure
muffat
prit
congé
et
comme
la
jeune
femme
laccompagnait
il
demanda
sans
lobtenir
un
rendezvous
pour
la
nuit
suivante
steiner
presque
aussitôt
monta
se
coucher
en
grognant
contre
les
éternels
bobos
des
filles
enfin
les
deux
vieux
étaient
emballés
lorsquelle
put
le
rejoindre
nana
trouva
georges
toujours
bien
sage
derrière
son
rideau
la
chambre
était
noire
il
lavait
fait
tomber
par
terre
assise
près
de
lui
et
ils
jouaient
ensemble
à
se
rouler
sarrêtant
étouffant
leurs
rires
sous
des
baisers
lorsquils
donnaient
contre
un
meuble
un
coup
de
leurs
pieds
nus
au
loin
sur
la
route
de
gumières
le
comte
muffat
sen
allait
lentement
son
chapeau
à
la
main
baignant
sa
tête
brûlante
dans
la
fraîcheur
et
le
silence
de
la
nuit
alors
les
jours
suivants
la
vie
fut
adorable
nana
entre
les
bras
du
petit
retrouvait
ses
quinze
ans
cétait
sous
la
caresse
de
cette
enfance
une
fleur
damour
refleurissant
chez
elle
dans
lhabitude
et
le
dégoût
de
lhomme
il
lui
venait
des
rougeurs
subites
un
émoi
qui
la
laissait
frissonnante
un
besoin
de
rire
et
de
pleurer
toute
une
virginité
inquiète
traversée
de
désirs
dont
elle
restait
honteuse
jamais
elle
navait
éprouvé
cela
la
campagne
la
trempait
de
tendresse
etant
petite
longtemps
elle
avait
souhaité
vivre
dans
un
pré
avec
une
chèvre
parce
quun
jour
sur
le
talus
des
fortifications
elle
avait
vu
une
chèvre
qui
bêlait
attachée
à
un
pieu
maintenant
cette
propriété
toute
cette
terre
à
elle
la
gonflait
dune
émotion
débordante
tant
ses
ambitions
se
trouvaient
dépassées
elle
était
ramenée
aux
sensations
neuves
dune
gamine
et
le
soir
lorsque
étourdie
par
sa
journée
vécue
au
grand
air
grisée
de
lodeur
des
feuilles
elle
montait
rejoindre
son
zizi
caché
derrière
le
rideau
ça
lui
semblait
une
escapade
de
pensionnaire
en
vacances
un
amour
avec
un
petit
cousin
quelle
devait
épouser
tremblante
au
moindre
bruit
redoutant
que
ses
parents
ne
lentendissent
goûtant
les
tâtonnements
délicieux
et
les
voluptueuses
épouvantes
dune
première
faute
nana
eut
à
ce
moment
des
fantaisies
de
fille
sentimentale
elle
regardait
la
lune
pendant
des
heures
une
nuit
elle
voulut
descendre
au
jardin
avec
georges
quand
toute
la
maison
fut
endormie
et
ils
se
promenèrent
sous
les
arbres
les
bras
à
la
taille
et
ils
allèrent
se
coucher
dans
lherbe
où
la
rosée
les
trempa
une
autre
fois
dans
la
chambre
après
un
silence
elle
sanglota
au
cou
du
petit
en
balbutiant
quelle
avait
peur
de
mourir
elle
chantait
souvent
à
demivoix
une
romance
de
madame
lerat
pleine
de
fleurs
et
doiseaux
sattendrissant
aux
larmes
sinterrompant
pour
prendre
georges
dans
une
étreinte
de
passion
en
exigeant
de
lui
des
serments
damour
éternel
enfin
elle
était
bête
comme
elle
le
reconnaissait
ellemême
lorsque
tous
les
deux
redevenus
camarades
fumaient
des
cigarettes
au
bord
du
lit
les
jambes
nues
tapant
le
bois
des
talons
mais
ce
qui
acheva
de
fondre
le
coeur
de
la
jeune
femme
ce
fut
larrivée
de
louiset
sa
crise
de
maternité
eut
la
violence
dun
coup
de
folie
elle
emportait
son
fils
au
soleil
pour
le
regarder
gigoter
elle
se
roulait
avec
lui
sur
lherbe
après
lavoir
habillé
comme
un
jeune
prince
tout
de
suite
elle
voulut
quil
dormît
près
delle
dans
la
chambre
voisine
où
madame
lerat
très
impressionnée
par
la
campagne
ronflait
dès
quelle
était
sur
le
dos
et
louiset
ne
faisait
pas
le
moindre
tort
à
zizi
au
contraire
elle
disait
quelle
avait
deux
enfants
elle
les
confondait
dans
le
même
caprice
de
tendresse
la
nuit
à
plus
de
dix
reprises
elle
lâchait
zizi
pour
voir
si
louiset
avait
une
bonne
respiration
mais
quand
elle
revenait
elle
reprenait
son
zizi
avec
un
restant
de
ses
caresses
maternelles
elle
faisait
la
maman
tandis
que
lui
vicieux
aimant
bien
être
petit
aux
bras
de
cette
grande
fille
se
laissait
bercer
comme
un
bébé
quon
endort
cétait
si
bon
que
charmée
de
cette
existence
elle
lui
proposa
sérieusement
de
ne
plus
jamais
quitter
la
campagne
ils
renverraient
tout
le
monde
ils
vivraient
seuls
lui
elle
et
lenfant
et
ils
firent
mille
projets
jusqu
à
laube
sans
entendre
madame
lerat
qui
ronflait
à
poings
fermés
lasse
davoir
cueilli
des
fleurs
champêtres
cette
belle
vie
dura
près
dune
semaine
le
comte
muffat
venait
tous
les
soirs
et
sen
retournait
la
face
gonflée
les
mains
brûlantes
un
soir
il
ne
fut
même
pas
reçu

ayant
dû
faire
un
voyage
à

dit
que
madame

souffrante

révoltait
davantage
chaque
jour
à
lidée
de
tromper
georges
un
petit
si
innocent
et
qui
croyait
en
elle
elle
se
serait
regardée
comme
la
dernière
des
dernières
puis
ça
laurait
dégoûtée
zoé
qui
assistait
muette
et
dédaigneuse
à
cette
aventure
pensait
que
madame
devenait
bête
le
sixième
jour
tout
dun
coup
une
bande
de
visiteurs
tomba
dans
cette
idylle
nana

invité

quon

dune
heure
lorsque

enchantée
de
jouer
à
la
châtelaine
ces
dames

complimentaient
sur

puis
elles

apportaient
une
bouffée
de
lair

soir
même
que

petite
violaine
obtenait
dans
la
blonde

un
très
joli
succès

nouvelle

un
tour
vous

dit
nana
je
partais
ramasser
des
pommes
de
terre
quand

alors
tous
voulurent
aller
ramasser
des
pommes
de
terre
sans
même
changer
de
vêtements
ce
fut
une
partie
le
jardinier
et
deux
aides
se
trouvaient
déjà
dans
le
champ
au
fond
de
la
propriété
ces
dames
se
mirent
à
genoux
fouillant
la
terre
avec
leurs
bagues
poussant
des
cris
lorsquelles
découvraient
une
pomme
de
terre
très
grosse
ça
leur
semblait
si
amusant
mais
tatan
néné
triomphait
elle
en
avait
tellement
ramassé
dans
sa
jeunesse
quelle
soubliait
et
donnait
des
conseils
aux
autres
en
les
traitant
de
bêtes
les
messieurs
travaillaient

mollement

lair
brave
homme

de
son
séjour
à
la

pour

léducation
de
ses
fils

leur
parlait
de

le
soir
le
dîner

dune
gaieté
folle

nana
très
lancée

avec
son
maître
dhôtel
un
garçon
qui
avait
servi
à
lévêché

au
café
les
dames
fumèrent
un
bruit
de
noce
à
tout
casser
sortait
par
les
fenêtres

mourait
au
loin
dans
la
sérénité
du
soir
tandis
que
les
paysans
attardés
entre
les
haies
tournant
la
tête
regardaient
la
maison
flambante
ah
cest
embêtant
que
vous
repartiez
aprèsdemain
dit
nana
enfin
nous
allons
toujours
organiser
quelque
chose
et
lon
décida
quon

le
lendemain
un
dimanche
visiter
les
ruines
de

se
trouvaient
à
sept

ramèneraient

sept
heures
ce
serait
charmant
ce
soirlà
comme
dhabitude
le
comte
muffat
monta
le
coteau
pour
sonner
à
la
grille
mais
le
flamboiement
des
fenêtres
les
grands
rires
létonnèrent
il
comprit
en
reconnaissant
la
voix
de
mignon
et
séloigna
enragé
par
ce
nouvel
obstacle
poussé
à
bout
résolu
à
quelque
violence
georges
qui
passait
par
une
petite
porte
dont
il
avait
une
clef
monta
tranquillement
dans
la
chambre
de
nana
en
filant
le
long
des
murs
seulement
il
dut
lattendre
jusqu
à
minuit
passé
elle
parut
enfin
très
grise
plus
maternelle
encore
que
les
autres
nuits
quand
elle
buvait
ça
la
rendait
si
amoureuse
quelle
en
devenait
collante
ainsi
elle
voulait
absolument
quil
laccompagnât
à
labbaye
de
chamont
lui
résistait
ayant
peur
dêtre
vu
si
lapercevait
en
voiture
avec
elle
ça
ferait
un
scandale
abominable
mais
elle
fondit
en
larmes
prise
dun
désespoir
bruyant
de
femme
sacrifiée
et
il
la
consola
il
lui
promit
formellement
dêtre
de
la
partie
alors
tu

que

ferait
beaucoup
de
peine
aux
fondettes
le
voisinage
de
nana
bouleversait
la
maison
chaque
matin
pendant
le
déjeuner
la
bonne
madame
hugon
revenait
malgré
elle
sur
cette
femme
racontant
ce
que
son
jardinier
lui
rapportait
éprouvant
cette
sorte
dobsession
quexercent
les
filles
sur
les
bourgeoises
les
plus
dignes
elle
si
tolérante
était
révoltée
exaspérée
avec
le
vague
pressentiment
dun
malheur
qui
leffrayait
le
soir
comme
si
elle
eût
connu
la
présence
dans
la
contrée
dune
bête
échappée
de
quelque
ménagerie
aussi
cherchaitelle
querelle
à
ses
invités
en
les
accusant
tous
de
rôder
autour
de
la
mignotte
avait
vu
le
comte
de
vandeuvres
rire
sur
une
grande
route
avec
une
dame
en
cheveux
mais
il
se
défendait
il
reniait
nana
car
cétait
en
effet
lucy
qui
laccompagnait
pour
lui
conter
comment
elle
venait
de
flanquer
son
troisième
prince
à
la
porte
le
marquis
de
chouard
sortait
aussi
tous
les
jours
seulement
il
parlait
dune
ordonnance
de
son
docteur
pour
daguenet
et
fauchery
madame
hugon
se
montrait
injuste
le
premier
surtout
ne
quittait
pas
les
fondettes
renonçant
au
projet
de
renouer
montrant
auprès
destelle
un
respectueux
empressement
fauchery
restait
de
même
avec
les
dames
muffat
une
seule
fois
il
avait
rencontré
dans
un
sentier
mignon
les
bras
pleins
de
fleurs
faisant
un
cours
de
botanique
à
ses
fils
les
deux
hommes
sétaient
serré
la
main
en
se
donnant
des
nouvelles
de
rose
elle
se
portait
parfaitement
ils
avaient
chacun
reçu
le
matin
une
lettre
où
elle
les
priait
de
profiter
quelque
temps
encore
du
bon
air
de
tous
ses
hôtes
la
vieille
dame
népargnait
donc
que
le
comte
muffat
et
georges
le
comte
qui
prétendait
avoir
de
graves
affaires
à
orléans
ne
pouvait
courir
la
gueuse
et
quant
à
georges
le
pauvre
enfant
finissait
par
linquiéter
car
il
était
pris
chaque
soir
de
migraines
épouvantables
qui
le
forçaient
de
se
coucher
au
jour
cependant
fauchery
sétait
fait
le
cavalier
ordinaire
de
la
comtesse
sabine
tandis
que
le
comte
sabsentait
toutes
les
aprèsmidi
lorsquon
allait
au
bout
du
parc
il
portait
son
pliant
et
son
ombrelle
dailleurs
il
lamusait
par
son
esprit
baroque
de
petit
journaliste
il
la
poussait
à
une
de
ces
intimités
soudaines
que
la
campagne
autorise
elle
avait
paru
se
livrer
tout
de
suite
éveillée
à
une
nouvelle
jeunesse
en
compagnie
de
ce
garçon
dont
la
moquerie
bruyante
ne
semblait
pouvoir
la
compromettre
et
parfois
lorsquils
se
trouvaient
seuls
une
seconde
derrière
un
buisson
leurs
yeux
se
cherchaient
ils
sarrêtaient
au
milieu
dun
rire
brusquement
sérieux
avec
un
regard
noir
comme
sils
sétaient
pénétrés
et
compris
le
vendredi
au
déjeuner
il
avait
fallu
mettre
un
nouveau
couvert
théophile
venot
que
madame
hugon
se
souvint
davoir
invité
lhiver
dernier
chez
les
muffat
venait
darriver
il
arrondissait
le
dos
il
affectait
une
bonhomie
dhomme
insignifiant
sans
paraître
sapercevoir
de
la
déférence
inquiète
quon
lui
témoignait
quand
il
eut
réussi
à
se
faire
oublier
tout
en
croquant
de
petits
morceaux
de
sucre
au
dessert
il
examina
daguenet
qui
passait
des
fraises
à
estelle
il
écouta
fauchery
dont
une
anecdote
égayait
beaucoup
la
comtesse
dès
quon
le
regardait
il
souriait
de
son
air
tranquille
au
sortir
de
table
il
prit
le
bras
du
comte
il
lemmena
dans
le
parc
savait
quil
gardait
sur
celuici
une
grande
influence
depuis
la
mort
de
sa
mère
des
histoires
singulières
couraient
au
sujet
de
la
domination
exercée
dans
la
maison
par
lancien
avoué
fauchery
que
son
arrivée
gênait
sans
doute
expliquait
à
georges
et
à
daguenet
les
sources
de
sa
fortune
un
gros
procès
dont
les
jésuites
lavaient
chargé
autrefois
et
selon
lui
ce
bonhomme
un
terrible
monsieur
avec
sa
mine
douce
et
grasse
trempait
maintenant
dans
tous
les
tripotages
de
la
prêtraille
les
deux
jeunes
gens
sétaient
mis
à
plaisanter
car
ils
trouvaient
un
air
idiot
au
petit
vieillard
lidée
dun
venot
inconnu
dun
venot
gigantesque
instrumentant
pour
le
clergé
leur
semblait
une
imagination
comique
mais
ils
se
turent
lorsque
le
comte
muffat
reparut
toujours
au
bras
du
bonhomme
très
pâle
les
yeux
rouges
comme
sil
avait
pleuré
bien
sûr
ils
auront
causé
de
lenfer
murmura
fauchery
goguenard
la
comtesse
sabine
qui
avait
entendu
tourna
lentement
la
tête
et
leurs
yeux
se
rencontrèrent
avec
un
de
ces
longs
regards
dont
ils
se
sondaient
prudemment
avant
de
se
risquer
dhabitude
après
le
déjeuner
se
rendait
au
bout
du
parterre
sur
une
terrasse
qui
dominait
la
plaine
le
dimanche
laprèsmidi
fut
dune
douceur
exquise
avait
craint
de
la
pluie
vers
dix
heures
mais
le
ciel
sans
se
découvrir
sétait
comme
fondu
en
un
brouillard
laiteux
en
une
poussière
lumineuse
toute
blonde
de
soleil
alors
madame
hugon
proposa
de
descendre
par
la
petite
porte
de
la
terrasse
et
de
faire
une
promenade
à
pied
du
côté
de
gumières
jusqu
à
la
choue
elle
aimait
la
marche
très
alerte
encore
pour
ses
soixante
ans
tout
le
monde
dailleurs
jura
quon
navait
pas
besoin
de
voiture
arriva
ainsi
un
peu
débandé
au
pont
de
bois
jeté
sur
la
rivière
fauchery
et
daguenet
étaient
en
avant
avec
les
dames
muffat
le
comte
et
le
marquis
venaient
ensuite
aux
côtés
de
madame
hugon
tandis
que
vandeuvres
la
mine
correcte
et
ennuyée
sur
cette
grande
route
marchait
à
la
queue
fumant
un
cigare
venot
ralentissant
ou
pressant
le
pas
allait
dun
groupe
à
un
autre
avec
un
sourire
comme
pour
tout
entendre
et
ce
pauvre
georges
qui
est
à
orléans
répétait
madame
hugon
il
voulu
consulter
sur
ses
migraines
le
vieux
docteur
tavernier
qui
ne
sort
plus
oui
vous
nétiez
pas
levé
il
est
parti
avant
sept
heures
ça
le
distraira
toujours
mais
elle
sinterrompit
pour
dire
tiens
quontils
donc
à
sarrêter
sur
le
pont
en
effet
ces
dames
daguenet
fauchery
se
tenaient
immobiles
à
la
tête
du
pont
lair
hésitant
comme
si
un
obstacle
les
eût
inquiétés
le
chemin
était
libre
pourtant
avancez
cria
le
comte
ils
ne
bougèrent
pas
regardant
quelque
chose
qui
venait
et
que
les
autres
ne
pouvaient
voir
encore
la
route
tournait
bordée
dun
épais
rideau
de
peupliers
cependant
une
rumeur
sourde
grandissait
des
bruits
de
roue
mêlés
à
des
rires
à
des
claquements
de
fouet
et
tout
dun
coup
cinq
voitures
parurent
à
la
file
pleines
à
rompre
les
essieux
égayées
par
un
tapage
de
toilettes
claires
bleues
et
roses
questce
que
cest
que
ça
dit
madame
hugon
surprise
puis
elle
sentit
elle
devina
révoltée
dun
pareil
envahissement
de
sa
route
oh
cette
femme
murmuratelle
marchez
marchez
donc
nayez
pas
lair
mais
il
nétait
plus
temps
les
cinq
voitures
qui
conduisaient
nana
et
sa
société
aux
ruines
de
chamont
sengageaient
sur
le
petit
pont
de
bois
fauchery
daguenet
les
dames
muffat
durent
reculer
pendant
que
madame
hugon
et
les
autres
sarrêtaient
également
échelonnés
le
long
du
chemin
ce
fut
un
défilé
superbe
les
rires
avaient
cessé
dans
les
voitures
des
figures
se
tournaient
curieusement
se
dévisagea
au
milieu
dun
silence
que
coupait
seul
le
trot
cadencé
des
chevaux
dans
la
première
voiture
maria
blond
et
tatan
néné
renversées
comme
des
duchesses
les
jupes
bouffant
pardessus
les
roues
avaient
des
regards
dédaigneux
pour
ces
femmes
honnêtes
qui
allaient
à
pied
ensuite
gaga
emplissait
toute
une
banquette
noyant
près
delle
la
faloise
dont
ne
voyait
que
le
nez
inquiet
puis
venaient
caroline
héquet
avec
labordette
lucy
stewart
avec
mignon
et
ses
fils
et
tout
au
bout
occupant
une
victoria
en
compagnie
de
steiner
nana
qui
avait
devant
elle
sur
un
strapontin
ce
pauvre
mignon
de
zizi
fourrant
ses
genoux
dans
les
siens
cest
la
dernière
nestce
pas
demanda
tranquillement
la
comtesse
à
fauchery
en
affectant
de
ne
point
reconnaître
nana
la
roue
de
la
victoria
leffleura
presque
sans
quelle
fit
un
pas
en
arrière
les
deux
femmes
avaient
échangé
un
regard
profond
un
de
ces
examens
dune
seconde
complets
et
définitifs
quant
aux
hommes
ils
furent
tout
à
fait
bien
fauchery
et
daguenet
très
froids
ne
reconnurent
personne
le
marquis
anxieux
craignant
une
farce
de
la
part
de
ces
dames
avait
cassé
un
brin
dherbe
quil
roulait
entre
ses
doigts
seul
vandeuvres
resté
un
peu
à
lécart
salua
des
paupières
lucy
qui
lui
souriait
au
passage
prenez
garde
avait
murmuré
venot
debout
derrière
le
comte
muffat
celuici
bouleversé
suivait
des
yeux
cette
vision
de
nana
courant
devant
lui
sa
femme
lentement
sétait
tournée
et
lexaminait
alors
il
regarda
la
terre
comme
pour
échapper
au
galop
des
chevaux
qui
lui
emportaient
la
chair
et
le
coeur
il
aurait
crié
de
souffrance
il
venait
de
comprendre
en
apercevant
georges
perdu
dans
les
jupes
de
nana
un
enfant
cela
le
brisait
quelle
lui
eût
préféré
un
enfant
steiner
lui
était
égal
mais
cet
enfant
cependant
madame
hugon
navait
pas
reconnu
georges
dabord
lui
en
traversant
le
pont
aurait
sauté
dans
la
rivière
si
les
genoux
de
nana
ne
lavaient
retenu
alors
glacé
blanc
comme
un
linge
il
se
tint
très
raide
il
ne
regardait
personne
peutêtre
quon
ne
le
verrait
pas
ah
mon
dieu
dit
tout
à
coup
la
vieille
dame
cest
georges
qui
est
avec
elle
les
voitures
avaient
passé
au
milieu
de
ce
malaise
de
gens
qui
se
connaissaient
et
qui
ne
se
saluaient
pas
cette
rencontre
délicate
si
rapide
semblait
sêtre
éternisée
et
maintenant
les
roues
emportaient
plus
gaiement
dans
la
campagne
blonde
ces
charretées
de
filles
fouettées
de
grand
air
des
bouts
de
toilettes
vives
flottaient
des
rires
recommençaient
avec
des
plaisanteries
et
des
regards
jetés
en
arrière
sur
ces
gens
comme
il
faut
restés
au
bord
de
la
route
lair
vexé
nana
en
se
retournant
put
voir
les
promeneurs
hésiter
puis
revenir
sur
leurs
pas
sans
traverser
le
pont
madame
hugon
sappuyait
au
bras
du
comte
muffat
muette
et
si
triste
que
personne
nosait
la
consoler
dites

cria
nana
à
lucy
qui
se
penchait
dans
la
voiture
voisine

et
paul
un
garçon
pour

si
bonne
pas
seulement
un
signe
vrai
ils
sont
polis
et
elle
fit
une
scène
affreuse
à
steiner
qui
trouvait
très
correcte
lattitude
de
ces
messieurs
alors
elles
ne
méritaient
pas
même
un
coup
de
chapeau
le
premier
goujat
venu
pouvait
les
insulter
merci
il
était
propre
lui
aussi
cétait
complet

toujours
saluer
une
femme

haussa
les
épaules
depuis
la
veille
sa
mauvaise
humeur
grandissait
il
avait
reçu
des
lettres
qui
lobligeaient
à
partir
le
lendemain
matin
puis
ce
nétait
pas
drôle
de
venir
à
la
campagne
pour
dormir
sur
le
divan
du
salon
et
ce
pauvre
bébé
reprit
nana
subitement
attendrie
en
sapercevant
de
la
pâleur
de
georges
qui
était
resté
raide
la
respiration
coupée
croyezvous

georges
très
inquiet

moimême
et
puis
si
mennuie
je
ne
rentre
plus
mais
il
demeura
absorbé
cherchant
des
mensonges
pour
le
soir
les
cinq
voitures
roulaient
en
plaine
sur
une
interminable
route
droite
bordée
de
beaux
arbres
lair
dun
gris
argenté
baignait
la
campagne
ces
dames
continuaient
à
se
crier
des
phrases
dune
voiture
à
lautre
derrière
le
dos
des
cochers
qui
riaient
de
ce
drôle
de
monde
par
moments
une
delles
se
mettait
debout
pour
voir
puis
sentêtait
appuyée
aux
épaules
dun
voisin
tant
quune
secousse
ne
la
rejetait
pas
sur
la
banquette
caroline
héquet
cependant
était
en
grande
conversation
avec
labordette
tous
deux
tombaient
daccord
que
nana
vendrait
sa
campagne
avant
trois
mois
et
caroline
chargeait
labordette
de
lui
racheter
ça
en
sousmain
pour
quatre
sous
devant
eux
la
faloise
très
amoureux
ne
pouvant
atteindre
la
nuque
apoplectique
de
gaga
lui
baisait
un
coin
de
léchine
sur
sa
robe
dont
létoffe
tendue
craquait
tandis
que
raide
au
bord
du
strapontin
amélie
leur
disait
de
finir
agacée
dêtre
là
les
bras
ballants
à
regarder
embrasser
sa
mère
dans
lautre
voiture
mignon
pour
étonner
lucy
exigeait
de
ses
fils
une
fable
de
la
fontaine
henri
surtout
était
prodigieux
il
vous
lâchait
ça
dun
trait
sans
se
reprendre
mais
maria
blond
en
tête
finissait
par
sembêter
lasse
de
faire
poser
cette
bûche
de
tatan
néné
à
qui
elle
racontait
que
les
crémières
de
paris
fabriquaient
des
oeufs
avec
de
la
colle
et
du
safran
cétait
trop
loin
narriverait
donc
pas
et
la
question
transmise
de
voiture
en
voiture
vint
jusqu
à
nana
qui
après
avoir
interrogé
son
cocher
se
leva
pour
crier
encore
un
petit
quart
dheure
vous
voyez
làbas
cette
église
derrière
les
arbres
puis
elle
reprit
vous
ne
savez

paraît
que
la
propriétaire
du
château
de
chamont

une
ancienne
du
temps
de
napoléon
oh

noceuse
dit
joseph

le

des

une
suite
dexclamations
emportées
dans
le
trot

vif
des
chevaux
des
têtes
sallongeaient
pour
voir
gaga
maria
blond
et
tatan
néné
se
tournèrent
à
genoux
sur
la
banquette
les
poings
dans
la
capote
renversée
et
des
questions
se
croisaient
avec
des
mots
méchants
que
tempérait
une
sourde
admiration
gaga
lavait
connue
ça
les
frappait
toutes
de
respect
pour
ce
passé
lointain
par
exemple

gaga

voiture
elle
vous

un
chic
et
des
histoires
épatantes
des
saletés

cétait
plus
drôle
arrivait
la
conversation
fut
coupée
par
les
claquements
de
fouet
des
cochers
qui
lançaient
leurs
bêtes
pourtant
au
milieu
du
bruit
lucy
continua
sautant
à
un
autre
sujet

nana
de
partir
avec
la
bande
le
lendemain

fermer
ces
dames
devaient
rentrer
à

où
la

en
serrant
les

de

sans
sinquiéter
de

brusquement
arrêtées

la
société
descendit
dans
un
endroit
désert
au
bas
dun
coteau
il
fallut
quun
des
cochers
leur
montrât
du
bout
de
son
fouet
les
ruines
de
lancienne
abbaye
de
chamont
perdues
dans
les
arbres
ce
fut
une
grosse
déception
les
dames
trouvèrent
ça
idiot
quelques
tas
de
décombres

de

avec
une
moitié
de
tour
écroulée
vrai
ça
ne
valait
pas
la
peine
de
faire
deux
lieues
le
cocher
leur
indiqua
alors
le
château
dont
le
parc
commençait
près
de
labbaye
en
leur
conseillant
de
prendre
un
petit
chemin
et
de
suivre
les
murs
ils
feraient
le
tour
pendant
que
les
voitures
iraient
les
attendre
sur
la
place
du
village
cétait
une
promenade
charmante
la
société
accepta
fichtre
irma
se
met
bien
dit
gaga
en
sarrêtant
devant
une
grille
dans
langle
du
parc
sur
la
route
tous
silencieusement
regardèrent
le
fourré
énorme
qui
bouchait
la
grille
puis
dans
le
petit
chemin
ils
suivirent
la
muraille
du
parc
levant
les
yeux
pour
admirer
les
arbres
dont
les
branches
hautes
débordaient
en
une
voûte
épaisse
de
verdure
au
bout
de
trois
minutes
ils
se
trouvèrent
devant
une
nouvelle
grille
cellelà
laissait
voir
une
large
pelouse
où
deux
chênes
séculaires
faisaient
des
nappes
dombre
et
trois
minutes
plus
loin
une
autre
grille
encore
déroula
devant
eux
une
avenue
immense
un
couloir
de
ténèbres
au
fond
duquel
le
soleil
mettait
la
tache
vive
dune
étoile
un
étonnement
dabord
silencieux
leur
tirait
peu
à
peu
des
exclamations
ils
avaient
bien
essayé
de
blaguer
avec
une
pointe
denvie
mais
décidément
ça
les
empoignait
quelle
force
cette
irma
cest
ça
qui
donnait
une
crâne
idée
de
la
femme
les
arbres
continuaient
et
sans
cesse
revenaient
des
manteaux
de
lierre
coulant
sur
le
mur
des
toits
de
pavillon
qui
dépassaient
des
rideaux
de
peupliers
qui
succédaient
à
des
masses
profondes
dormes
et
de
trembles
ça
ne
finirait
donc
pas
ces
dames
auraient
voulu
voir
lhabitation
lasses
de
toujours
tourner
sans
apercevoir
autre
chose
à
chaque
échappée
que
des
enfoncements
de
feuillage
elles
prenaient
les
barreaux
des
deux
mains
appuyant
le
visage
contre
le
fer
une
sensation
de
respect
les
envahissait
tenues
de
la
sorte
à
distance
rêvant
du
château
invisible
dans
cette
immensité
bientôt
ne
marchant
jamais
elles
éprouvèrent
une
fatigue
et
la
muraille
ne
cessait
point
à
tous
les
coudes
du
petit
chemin
désert
la
même
ligne
de
pierres
grises
sallongeait
quelquesunes
désespérant
darriver
au
bout
parlaient
de
revenir
en

mais
plus
la
course
les
brisait
et

elles
devenaient
respectueuses
emplies
davantage
à
chaque
pas
de
la
tranquille
et
royale
majesté
de
ce
domaine
cest

fit
taire
dun
haussement

depuis
un
moment

un
peu
pâle
très
sérieuse
brusquement
au
dernier
détour
comme
débouchait
sur
la

au

dune
cour

sarrêtèrent

par

instant
resta
sous

était
en

très
simple
et
très
grande
avec
la

dune
vieille

échappée
aux

dans

en

de

à
la

silencieuse

sétait
retournée
deux
fois
pour
jeter
un

sur

bercée
par
le
bruit
des

elle
ne

devant

heureusement
son

arrivé
un

heures
pour

au

les

sans

à

se
souvenait
davoir
fait
sauter
lili
sur

comme
les

grandissaient
elle
devenait
très
grasse
cette
petite
mais
le
comte

surtout
resta
silencieux
absorbé
la

rouge
il
avait
jeté
sur

un
long
regard
au
sortir
de

il
monta
senfermer
en

dun
peu
de
fièvre
derrière

sétait
précipité
et
il
eut
en

une
scène
le
comte
tombé
sur
le

étouffant
dans
son
oreiller
des
sanglots
nerveux
tandis
que

dune
voix
douce
lappelait
son

conseillait
dimplorer

il
ne

il
râlait
tout
dun

il
sauta
du

il
bégaya

courir
pour

la

pendant

conseillait
de
prendre
du

en
ayant

deux
fois
tous

et
comme

la
pressait
encore
de
partir
le

avec

nana
exaspérée
déclara
quelle
entendait
ne
pas
recevoir
de
conseils
dailleurs
elle
sétait
montrée
à
table
dun
colletmonté
ridicule
madame
lerat
ayant
lâché
un
mot
raide
elle
cria
que
nom
de
dieu
elle
nautorisait
personne
pas
même
sa
tante
à
dire
des
saletés
en
sa
présence
puis
elle
rasa
tout
le
monde
par
ses
bons
sentiments
un
accès
dhonnêteté
bête
avec
des
idées
déducation
religieuse
pour
louiset
et
tout
un
plan
de
bonne
conduite
pour
elle
comme
riait
elle
eut
des
mots
profonds
des
hochements
de
bourgeoise
convaincue
disant
que
lordre
seul
menait
à
la
fortune
et
quelle
ne
voulait
pas
mourir
sur
la
paille
ces
dames
agacées
se
récriaient
pas
possible
avait
changé
nana
mais
elle
immobile
retombait
dans
sa
rêverie
les
yeux
perdus
voyant
se
lever
la
vision
dune
nana
très
riche
et
très
saluée
montait
se
coucher
quand
muffat
se
présenta
ce
fut
labordette
qui
laperçut
dans
le
jardin
il
comprit
il
lui
rendit
le
service
décarter
steiner
et
de
le
conduire
par
la
main
le
long
du
corridor
obscur
jusqu
à
la
chambre
de
nana
labordette
pour
ces
sortes
daffaires
était
dune
distinction
parfaite
très
adroit
et
comme
ravi
de
faire
le
bonheur
des
autres
nana
ne
se
montra
pas
surprise
ennuyée
seulement
de
la
rage
de
muffat
après
elle
il
fallait
être
sérieuse
dans
la
vie
nestce
pas
cétait
trop
bête
daimer
ça
ne
menait
à
rien
puis
elle
avait
des
scrupules
à
cause
du
jeune
âge
de
zizi
vrai
elle
sétait
conduite
dune
façon
pas
honnête
foi
elle
rentrait
dans
le
bon
chemin
elle
prenait
un
vieux
zoé
ditelle
à
la
femme
de
chambre
enchantée
de
quitter
la
campagne
fais
les
malles
demain
en
te
levant
nous
retournons
à
paris
et
elle
coucha
avec
muffat
mais
sans
plaisir
vii
trois
mois
plus
tard
un
soir
de
décembre
le
comte
muffat
se
promenait
dans
le
passage
des
panoramas
la
soirée
était
très
douce
une
averse
venait
demplir
le
passage
dun
flot
de
monde
il
avait
là
une
cohue
un
défilé
pénible
et
lent
resserré
entre
les
boutiques
cétait
sous
les
vitres
blanchies
de
reflets
un
violent
éclairage
une
coulée
de
clartés
des
globes
blancs
des
lanternes
rouges
des
transparents
bleus
des
rampes
de
gaz
des
montres
et
des
éventails
géants
en
traits
de
flamme
brûlant
en
lair
et
le
bariolage
des
étalages
lor
des
bijoutiers
les
cristaux
des
confiseurs
les
soies
claires
des
modistes
flambaient
derrière
la
pureté
des
glaces
dans
le
coup
de
lumière
crue
des
réflecteurs
tandis
que
parmi
la
débandade
peinturlurée
des
enseignes
un
énorme
gant
de
pourpre
au
loin
semblait
une
main
saignante
coupée
et
attachée
par
une
manchette
jaune
doucement
le
comte
muffat
était
remonté
jusquau
boulevard
il
jeta
un
regard
sur
la
chaussée
puis
revint
à
petits
pas
rasant
les
boutiques
un
air
humide
et
chauffé
mettait
une
vapeur
lumineuse
dans
létroit
couloir
le
long
des
dalles
mouillées
par
légouttement
des
parapluies
les
pas
sonnaient
continuellement
sans
un
bruit
de
voix
des
promeneurs
en
le
coudoyant
à
chaque
tour
lexaminaient
la
face
muette
blêmie
par
le
gaz
alors
pour
échapper
à
ces
curiosités
le
comte
se
planta
devant
une
papeterie
où
il
contempla
avec
une
attention
profonde
un
étalage
de
pressepapiers
des
boules
de
verre
dans
lesquelles
flottaient
des
paysages
et
des
fleurs
il
ne
voyait
rien
il
songeait
à
nana
pourquoi
venaitelle
de
mentir
une
fois
encore
le
matin
elle
lui
avait
écrit
de
ne
pas
se
déranger
le
soir
en
prétextant
que
louiset
était
malade
et
quelle
passerait
la
nuit
chez
sa
tante
à
le
veiller
mais
lui
soupçonneux
sétant
présenté
chez
elle
avait
appris
par
la
concierge
que
madame
justement
partait
pour
son
théâtre
cela
létonnait
car
elle
ne
jouait
pas
dans
la
pièce
nouvelle
pourquoi
donc
ce
mensonge
et
que
pouvaitelle
faire
aux
variétés
ce
soirlà
bousculé
par
un
passant
le
comte
sans
en
avoir
conscience
quitta
les
pressepapiers
et
se
trouva
devant
une
vitrine
de
bimbeloterie
regardant
de
son
air
absorbé
un
étalage
de
carnets
et
de
portecigares
qui
tous
sur
un
coin
avaient
la
même
hirondelle
bleue
certainement
nana
était
changée
dans
les
premiers
temps
après
son
retour
de
la
campagne
elle
le
rendait
fou
quand
elle
le
baisait
autour
de
la
figure
sur
ses
favoris
avec
des
câlineries
de
chatte
en
lui
jurant
quil
était
le
chien
aimé
le
seul
petit
homme
quelle
adorât
il
navait
plus
peur
de
georges
retenu
par
sa
mère
aux
fondettes
restait
le
gros
steiner
quil
pensait
remplacer
mais
sur
lequel
il
nosait
provoquer
une
explication
il
le
savait
de
nouveau
dans
un
gâchis
dargent
extraordinaire
près
dêtre
exécuté
à
la
bourse
se
cramponnant
aux
actionnaires
des
salines
des
landes
tâchant
de
leur
faire
suer
un
dernier
versement
quand
il
le
rencontrait
chez
nana
celleci
lui
expliquait
dun
ton
raisonnable
quelle
ne
voulait
pas
le
flanquer
à
la
porte
comme
un
chien
après
ce
quil
avait
dépensé
pour
elle
dailleurs
depuis
trois
mois
il
vivait
au
milieu
dun
tel
étourdissement
sensuel
quen
dehors
du
besoin
de
la
posséder
il
néprouvait
rien
de
bien
net
cétait
dans
léveil
tardif
de
sa
chair
une
gloutonnerie
denfant
qui
ne
laissait
pas
de
place
à
la
vanité
ni
à
la
jalousie
une
seule
sensation
précise
pouvait
le
frapper
nana
devenait
moins
gentille
elle
ne
le
baisait
plus
sur
la
barbe
cela
linquiétait
il
se
demandait
ce
quelle
avait
à
lui
reprocher
en
homme
qui
ignore
les
femmes
cependant
il
croyait
contenter
tous
ses
désirs
et
il
revenait
toujours
à
la
lettre
du
matin
à
cette
complication
de
mensonge
dans
le
si
simple
de
passer
la
soirée
à
son
théâtre
sous
une
nouvelle
poussée
de
la
foule
il
avait
traversé
le
passage
il
se
creusait
la
tête
devant
un
vestibule
de
restaurant
les
yeux
fixés
sur
des
alouettes
plumées
et
sur
un
grand
saumon
allongé
dans
une
vitrine
enfin
il
parut
sarracher
à
ce
spectacle
il
se
secoua
leva
les
yeux
saperçut
quil
était
près
de
neuf
heures
nana
allait
sortir
il
exigerait
la
vérité
et
il
marcha
en
se
rappelant
les
soirées
passées
déjà
en
cet
endroit
quand
il
la
prenait
à
la
porte
du
théâtre
toutes
les
boutiques
lui
étaient
connues
il
en
retrouvait
les
odeurs
dans
lair
chargé
de
gaz
des
senteurs
rudes
de
cuir
de
russie
des
parfums
de
vanille
montant
du
soussol
dun
chocolatier
des
haleines
de
musc
soufflées
par
les
portes
ouvertes
des
parfumeurs
aussi
nosaitil
plus
sarrêter
devant
les
visages
pâles
des
dames
de
comptoir
qui
le
regardaient
placidement
en
figure
de
connaissance
un
instant
il
sembla
étudier
la
file
des
petites
fenêtres
rondes
audessus
des
magasins
comme
sil
les
voyait
pour
la
première
fois
dans
lencombrement
des
enseignes
puis
de
nouveau
il
monta
jusquau
boulevard
se
tint
là
une
minute
la
pluie
ne
tombait
plus
quen
une
poussière
fine
dont
le
froid
sur
ses
mains
le
calma
maintenant
il
songeait
à
sa
femme
qui
se
trouvait
près
de
mâcon
dans
un
château
où
son
amie
madame
de
chezelles
était
très
souffrante
depuis
lautomne
les
voitures
sur
la
chaussée
roulaient
au
milieu
dun
fleuve
de
boue
la
campagne
devait
être
abominable
par
ce
vilain
temps
mais
tout
à
coup
pris
dinquiétude
il
rentra
dans
la
chaleur
étouffée
du
passage
il
marcha
à
grandes
enjambées
parmi
les
promeneurs
la
pensée
lui
était
venue
que
si
nana
se
méfiait
elle
filerait
par
la
galerie
montmartre
dès
lors
le
comte
fit
le
guet
à
la
porte
même
du
théâtre
il
naimait
pas
attendre
dans
ce
bout
de
couloir
où
il
craignait
dêtre
reconnu
cétait
à
langle
de
la

un
coin
louche
avec
des
boutiques
obscures
une
cordonnerie
sans
clientèle
des
magasins
de
meubles
poussiéreux
un
cabinet
de
lecture
enfumé
somnolent
dont
les
lampes
encapuchonnées
dormaient
le
soir
dans
une
lueur
verte
et
il
n
avait
jamais
là
que
des
messieurs
bien
mis
et
patients
rôdant
parmi
ce
qui
encombre
une
entrée
des
artistes
des
soûleries
de
machinistes
et
des
guenilles
de
figurantes
devant
le
théâtre
un
seul
bec
de
gaz
dans
un
globe
dépoli
éclairait
la
porte
muffat
eut
un
moment
lidée
de
questionner
madame
bron
puis
la
crainte
lui
vint
que
nana
prévenue
ne
se
sauvât
par
le
boulevard
il
reprit
sa
marche
résolu
à
attendre
quon
le
mît
dehors
pour
fermer
les
grilles
comme
cela
était
arrivé
deux
fois
la
pensée
de
rentrer
coucher
seul
lui
serrait
le
coeur
dangoisse
chaque
fois
que
des
filles
en
cheveux
des
hommes
au
linge
sale
sortaient
et
le
dévisageaient
il
revenait
se
planter
devant
le
cabinet
de
lecture
où
entre
deux
affiches
collées
sur
une
vitre
il
retrouvait
le
même
spectacle
un
petit
vieux
raidi
et
seul
à
limmense
table
dans
la
tache
verte
dune
lampe
lisant
un
journal
vert
avec
des
mains
vertes
mais
quelques
minutes
avant
dix
heures
un
autre
monsieur
un
grand
bel
homme
blond
ganté
juste
se
promena
lui
aussi
devant
le
théâtre
alors
tous
deux
à
chaque
tour
se
jetèrent
un
coup
doeil
oblique
dun
air
méfiant
le
comte
poussait
jusqu
à
langle
des
deux
galeries
orné
dun
haut
panneau
de
glace
et
là
en
sapercevant
la
mine
grave
lallure
correcte
il
éprouvait
une
honte
mêlée
de
peur
dix
heures
sonnèrent
muffat
brusquement
pensa
quil
lui
était
bien
facile
de
sassurer
si
nana
se
trouvait
dans
sa
loge
il
monta
les
trois
marches
traversa
le
petit
vestibule
badigeonné
de
jaune
puis
se
glissa
dans
la
cour
par
une
porte
qui
fermait
simplement
au
loquet
cette
heure
la
cour
étroite
humide
comme
un
fond
de
puits
avec
ses
cabinets
daisances
empestés
sa
fontaine
le
fourneau
de
cuisine
et
les
plantes
dont
la
concierge
lencombrait
était
noyée
dune
vapeur
noire
mais
les
deux
murs
qui
se
dressaient
troués
de
fenêtres
flamboyaient
en
bas
le
magasin
des
accessoires
et
le
poste
des
pompiers
à
gauche
ladministration
à
droite
et
en
haut
les
loges
des
artistes
cétait
le
long
de
ce
puits
comme
des
gueules
de
four
ouvertes
sur
les
ténèbres
le
comte
avait
tout
de
suite
vu
les
vitres
de
la
loge
éclairées
au
premier
étage
et
soulagé
heureux
il
soubliait
les
yeux
en
lair
dans
la
boue
grasse
et
la
fade
puanteur
de
ce
derrière
de
vieille
maison
parisienne
de
grosses
gouttes
tombaient
dune
gouttière
crevée
un
rayon
de
gaz
glissé
de
la
fenêtre
de
madame
bron
jaunissait
un
bout
de
pavé
moussu
un
bas
de
muraille
mangé
par
les
eaux
dun
évier
tout
un
coin
dordures
embarrassé
de
vieux
seaux
et
de
terrines
fendues
où
verdissait
dans
une
marmite
un
maigre
fusain
il
eut
un
grincement
despagnolette
le
comte
se
sauva
certainement
nana
allait
descendre
il
retourna
devant
le
cabinet
de
lecture
dans
lombre
endormie
tachée
dune
lueur
de
veilleuse
le
petit
vieux
navait
pas
bougé
le
profil
cassé
sur
son
journal
puis
il
marcha
encore
maintenant
il
poussait
sa
promenade
plus
loin
il
traversait
la
grande
galerie
suivait
la
galerie
des
variétés
jusqu
à
la
galerie
feydeau
déserte
et
froide
enfoncée
dans
une
obscurité
lugubre
et
il
revenait
il
passait
devant
le
théâtre
tournait
le
coin
de
la
galerie
saintmarc
se
risquait
jusqu
à
la
galerie
montmartre
où
une
machine
sciant
du
sucre
chez
un
épicier
lintéressait
mais
au
troisième
tour
la
peur
que
nana
ne
séchappât
derrière
son
dos
lui
fit
perdre
tout
respect
humain
il
se
planta
avec
le
monsieur
blond
devant
le
théâtre
même
échangeant
tous
deux
un
regard
dhumilité
fraternelle
allumé
dun
restant
de
défiance
sur
une
rivalité
possible
des
machinistes
qui
sortaient
fumer
une
pipe
pendant
un
entracte
les
bousculèrent
sans
que
lun
ni
lautre
osât
se
plaindre
trois
grandes
filles
mal
peignées
en
robes
sales
parurent
sur
le
seuil
croquant
des
pommes
crachant
les
trognons
et
ils
baissèrent
la
tête
ils
restèrent
sous
leffronterie
de
leurs
yeux
et
la
crudité
de
leurs
paroles
éclaboussés
salis
par
ces
coquines
qui
trouvèrent
drôle
de
se
jeter
sur
eux
en
se
poussant
justement
nana
descendait
les
trois
marches
elle
devint
toute
blanche
lorsquelle
aperçut
muffat
ah
cest
vous
balbutiatelle
les
figurantes
qui
ricanaient
eurent
peur
en
la
reconnaissant
et
elles
demeuraient
plantées
en
ligne
dun
air
raide
et
sérieux
de
servantes
surprises
par
madame
en
train
de
mal
faire
le
grand
monsieur
blond
sétait
écarté
à
la
fois
rassuré
et
triste
eh
bien
donnezmoi
le
bras
reprit
nana
avec
impatience
ils
sen
allèrent
doucement
le
comte
qui
avait
préparé
des
questions
ne
trouvait
rien
à
dire
ce
fut
elle
qui
dune
voix
rapide
conta
une
histoire
elle
était
encore
chez
sa
tante
à
huit
heures
puis
voyant
louiset
beaucoup
mieux
elle
avait
eu
lidée
de
descendre
un
instant
au
théâtre
quelque
affaire
importante
demandatil
oui
une
pièce
nouvelle
réponditelle
après
avoir
hésité
voulait
avoir
mon
avis
il
comprit
quelle
mentait
mais
la
sensation
tiède
de
son
bras
fortement
appuyé
sur
le
sien
le
laissait
sans
force
il
navait
plus
ni
colère
ni
rancune
de
sa
longue
attente
son
unique
souci
était
de
la
garder
là
maintenant
quil
la
tenait
le
lendemain
il
tâcherait
de
savoir
ce
quelle
était
venue
faire
dans
sa
loge
nana
toujours
hésitante
visiblement
en
proie
au
travail
intérieur
dune
personne
qui
tâche
de
se
remettre
et
de
prendre
un
parti
sarrêta
en
tournant
le
coin
de
la
galerie
des
variétés
devant
létalage
dun
éventailliste
tiens
murmuratelle
cest
joli
cette
garniture
de
nacre
avec
ces
plumes
puis
dun
ton
indifférent
alors
tu
maccompagnes
chez
moi
mais
sans
doute
ditil
étonné
puisque
ton
enfant
va
mieux
elle
regretta
son
histoire
peutêtre
louiset
avaitil
une
nouvelle
crise
et
elle
parla
de
retourner
aux
batignolles
mais
comme
il
offrait
aller
aussi
elle
ninsista
pas
un
instant
elle
eut
la
rage
blanche
dune
femme
qui
se
sent
prise
et
qui
doit
se
montrer
douce
enfin
elle
se
résigna
elle
résolut
de
gagner
du
temps
pourvu
quelle
se
débarrassât
du
comte
vers
minuit
tout
sarrangerait
à
son
désir
cest
vrai
tu
es
garçon
ce
soir
murmuratelle
ta
femme
ne
revient
que
demain
matin
nestce
pas
oui
répondit
muffat
un
peu
gêné
de
lentendre
parler
familièrement
de
la
comtesse
mais
elle
appuya
demandant
lheure
du
train
voulant
savoir
sil
irait
à
la
gare
lattendre
elle
avait
encore
ralenti
le
pas
comme
très
intéressée
par
les
boutiques
vois
donc
ditelle
arrêtée
de
nouveau
devant
un
bijoutier
quel
drôle
de
bracelet
elle
adorait
le
passage
des
panoramas
cétait
une
passion
qui
lui
restait
de
sa
jeunesse
pour
le
clinquant
de
larticle
de
paris
les
bijoux
faux
le
zinc
doré
le
carton
jouant
le
cuir
quand
elle
passait
elle
ne
pouvait
sarracher
des
étalages
comme
à
lépoque
où
elle
traînait
ses
savates
de
gamine
soubliant
devant
les
sucreries
dun
chocolatier
écoutant
jouer
de
lorgue
dans
une
boutique
voisine
prise
surtout
par
le
goût
criard
des
bibelots
à
bon
marché
des
nécessaires
dans
des
coquilles
de
noix
des
hottes
de
chiffonnier
pour
les
curedents
des
colonnes
vendôme
et
des
obélisques
portant
des
thermomètres
mais
ce
soirlà
elle
était
trop
secouée
elle
regardait
sans
voir
ça
lennuyait
à
la
fin
de
nêtre
pas
libre
et
dans
sa
révolte
sourde
montait
le
furieux
besoin
de
faire
une
bêtise
la
belle
avance
davoir
des
hommes
bien
elle
venait
de
manger
le
prince
et
steiner
à
des
caprices
denfant
sans
quelle
sût
où
largent
passait
son
appartement
du
boulevard
haussmann
nétait
même
pas
entièrement
meublé
seul
le
salon
tout
en
satin
rouge
détonnait
trop
orné
et
trop
plein
cette
heure
pourtant
les
créanciers
la
tourmentaient
plus
quautrefois
lorsquelle
navait
pas
le
sou
chose
qui
lui
causait
une
continuelle
surprise
car
elle
se
citait
comme
un
modèle
déconomie
depuis
un
mois
ce
voleur
de
steiner
trouvait
mille
francs
à
grandpeine
les
jours
où
elle
menaçait
de
le
flanquer
dehors
sil
ne
les
apportait
pas
quant
à
muffat
il
était
idiot
il
ignorait
ce
quon
donnait
et
elle
ne
pouvait
lui
en
vouloir
de
son
avarice
ah
comme
elle
aurait
lâché
tout
ce
monde
si
elle
ne
sétait
répété
vingt
fois
par
jour
des
maximes
de
bonne
conduite
il
fallait
être
raisonnable
zoé
le
disait
chaque
matin
ellemême
avait
toujours
présent
un
souvenir
religieux
la
vision
royale
de
chamont
sans
cesse
évoquée
et
grandie
et
cétait
pourquoi
malgré
un
tremblement
de
colère
contenue
elle
se
faisait
soumise
au
bras
du
comte
en
allant
dune
vitrine
à
lautre
au
milieu
des
passants
plus
rares
dehors
le
pavé
séchait
un
vent
frais
qui
enfilait
la
galerie
balayait
lair
chaud
sous
le
vitrage
effarait
les
lanternes
de
couleur
les
rampes
de
gaz
léventail
géant
brûlant
comme
une
pièce
dartifice
la
porte
du
restaurant
un
garçon
éteignait
les
globes
tandis
que
dans
les
boutiques
vides
et
flambantes
les
dames
de
comptoir
immobiles
semblaient
sêtre
endormies
les
yeux
ouverts
oh
cet
amour
reprit
nana
au
dernier
étalage
revenant
de
quelques
pas
pour
sattendrir
sur
une
levrette
en
biscuit
une
patte
levée
devant
un
nid
caché
dans
des
roses
ils
quittèrent
enfin
le
passage
et
elle
ne
voulut
pas
de
voiture
il
faisait
très
bon
disaitelle
dailleurs
rien
ne
les
pressait
ce
serait
charmant
de
rentrer
à
pied
puis
arrivée
devant
le
café
anglais
elle
eut
une
envie
elle
parla
de
manger
des
huîtres
racontant
quelle
navait
rien
pris
depuis
le
matin
à
cause
de
la
maladie
de
louiset
muffat
nosa
la
contrarier
il
ne
saffichait
pas
encore
avec
elle
il
demanda
un
cabinet
filant
vite
le
long
des
corridors
elle
le
suivait
en
femme
qui
connaissait
la
maison
et
ils
allaient
entrer
dans
un
cabinet
dont
un
garçon
tenait
la
porte
ouverte
lorsque
dun
salon
voisin
où
sélevait
une
tempête
de
rires
et
de
cris
un
homme
sortit
brusquement
cétait
daguenet
tiens
nana
criatil
vivement
le
comte
avait
disparu
dans
le
cabinet
dont
la
porte
resta
entrebâillée
mais
comme
son
dos
rond
fuyait
daguenet
cligna
les
yeux
en
ajoutant
dun
ton
de
blague
fichtre
tu
vas
bien
tu
les
prends
aux
tuileries
maintenant
nana
sourit
un
doigt
sur
les
lèvres
pour
le
prier
de
se
taire
elle
le
voyait
très
lancé
heureuse
pourtant
de
le
rencontrer
là
lui
gardant
un
coin
de
tendresse
malgré
sa
saleté
de
ne
pas
la
reconnaître
lorsquil
se
trouvait
avec
des
femmes
comme
il
faut
que
devienstu
demandatelle
amicalement
je
range
vrai
je
songe
à
marier
elle
haussa
les
épaules
dun
air
de
pitié
mais
lui
en
plaisantant
continuait
disait
que
ce
nétait
pas
une
vie
de
gagner
à
la
bourse
juste
de
quoi
donner
des
bouquets
aux
dames
pour
rester
au
moins
un
garçon
propre
ses
trois
cent
mille
francs
lui
avaient
duré
dixhuit
mois
il
voulait
être
pratique
il
épouserait
une
grosse
dot
et
finirait
préfet
comme
son
père
nana
souriait
toujours
incrédule
elle
indiqua
le
salon
dun
mouvement
de
tête
avec
qui
estu
là
oh
toute
une
bande
ditil
oubliant
ses
projets
sous
une
bouffée
divresse
imaginetoi
que
léa
raconte
son
voyage
en
égypte
cest
dun
drôle
il
une
histoire
de
bain
et
il
raconta
lhistoire
nana
sattardait
complaisamment
ils
avaient
fini
par
sadosser
lun
devant
lautre
dans
le
corridor
des
becs
de
gaz
brûlaient
sous
le
plafond
bas
une
vague
odeur
de
cuisine
dormait
entre
les
plis
des
tentures
par
moments
pour
sentendre
lorsque
le
vacarme
du
salon
redoublait
ils
devaient
approcher
leurs
visages
toutes
les
vingt
secondes
un
garçon
chargé
de
plats
trouvant
le
corridor
barré
les
dérangeait
mais
eux
sans
sinterrompre
seffaçaient
contre
les
murs
tranquilles
causant
comme
chez
eux
au
milieu
du
tapage
des
soupeurs
et
de
la
bousculade
du
service
vois
donc
murmura
le
jeune
homme
en
montrant
dun
signe
la
porte
du
cabinet
où
muffat
avait
disparu
tous
deux
regardèrent
la
porte
avait
de
petits
frémissements
un
souffle
semblait
lagiter
enfin
avec
une
lenteur
extrême
elle
se
ferma
sans
le
moindre
bruit
ils
échangèrent
un
rire
silencieux
le
comte
devait
avoir
une
bonne
tête
seul
làdedans
propos
demandatelle
astu
lu
larticle
de
fauchery
sur
moi
oui
la
mouche
dor
répondit
daguenet
je
ne
ten
parlais
pas
craignant
de
te
faire
de
la
peine
de
la
peine
pourquoi
il
est
très
long
son
article
elle
était
flattée
quon
soccupât
de
sa
personne
dans
le
figaro
sans
les
explications
de
son
coiffeur
francis
qui
lui
avait
apporté
le
journal
elle
naurait
pas
compris
quil
sagissait
delle
daguenet
lexaminait
en
dessous
en
ricanant
de
son
air
blagueur
enfin
puisquelle
était
contente
tout
le
monde
devait
lêtre
excusez
cria
un
garçon
qui
les
sépara
tenant
à
deux
mains
une
bombe
glacée
nana
avait
fait
un
pas
vers
le
petit
salon
où
muffat
attendait
eh
bien
adieu
reprit
daguenet
va
retrouver
ton
cocu
de
nouveau
elle
sarrêta
pourquoi
lappellestu
cocu
parce
que
cest
un
cocu
parbleu
elle
revint
sadosser
au
mur
profondément
intéressée
ah
ditelle
simplement
comment
tu
ne
savais
pas
ça
sa
femme
couche
avec
fauchery
chère
ça
doit
avoir
commencé
à
la
campagne
tout
à
lheure
fauchery
quitté
comme
je
venais
ici
et
je
doute
dun
rendezvous
chez
lui
pour
ce
soir
ils
ont
inventé
un
voyage
je
crois
nana
demeurait
muette
sous
le
coup
de
lémotion
je
men
doutais
ditelle
enfin
en
tapant
sur
ses
cuisses
javais
deviné
rien
qu
à
la
voir
lautre
fois
sur
la
route
si
cest
possible
une
femme
honnête
tromper
son
mari
et
avec
cette
roulure
de
fauchery
il
va
lui
en
apprendre
de
propres
oh
murmura
daguenet
méchamment
ce
nest
pas
son
coup
dessai
elle
en
sait
peutêtre
autant
que
lui
alors
elle
eut
une
exclamation
indignée
vrai
quel
joli
monde
cest
trop
sale
excusez
cria
un
garçon
chargé
de
bouteilles
en
les
séparant
daguenet
la
ramena
la
retint
un
instant
par
la
main
il
avait
pris
sa
voix
de
cristal
une
voix
aux
notes
dharmonica
qui
faisait
tout
son
succès
auprès
de
ces
dames
adieu
chérie
tu
sais
je
taime
toujours
elle
se
dégagea
et
souriante
la
parole
couverte
par
un
tonnerre
de
cris
et
de
bravos
dont
la
porte
du
salon
tremblait
bête
cest
fini
mais
ça
ne
fait
rien
monte
donc
un
de
ces
jours
nous
causerons
puis
redevenant
très
grave
du
ton
dune
bourgeoise
révoltée
ah
il
est
cocu
eh
bien
mon
cher
cest
embêtant
moi
ça
toujours
dégoûtée
un
cocu
quand
elle
entra
enfin
dans
le
cabinet
elle
aperçut
muffat
assis
sur
un
étroit
divan
qui
se
résignait
la
face
blanche
les
mains
nerveuses
il
ne
lui
fit
aucun
reproche
elle
toute
remuée
était
partagée
entre
la
pitié
et
le
mépris
ce
pauvre
homme
quune
vilaine
femme
trompait
si
indignement
elle
avait
envie
de
se
jeter
à
son
cou
pour
le
consoler
mais
tout
de
même
cétait
juste
il
était
idiot
avec
les
femmes
ça
lui
apprendrait
cependant
la
pitié
lemporta
elle
ne
le
lâcha
pas
après
avoir
mangé
ses
huîtres
comme
elle
se
létait
promis
ils
restèrent
à
peine
un
quart
dheure
au
café
anglais
et
rentrèrent
ensemble
boulevard
haussmann
il
était
onze
heures
avant
minuit
elle
aurait
bien
trouvé
un
moyen
doux
de
le
congédier
par
prudence
dans
lantichambre
elle
donna
un
ordre
à
zoé
tu
le
guetteras
tu
lui
recommanderas
de
ne
pas
faire
de
bruit
si
lautre
est
encore
avec

où
le
mettraije
madame

à
la
cuisine
cest
plus
sûr
muffat
dans
la
chambre
ôtait
déjà
sa
redingote
un
grand
feu
brûlait
cétait
toujours
la
même
chambre
avec
ses
meubles
de
palissandre
ses
tentures
et
ses
sièges
de
damas
broché
à
grandes
fleurs
bleues
sur
fond
gris
deux
fois
nana
avait
rêvé
de
la
refaire
la
première
tout
en
velours
noir
la
seconde
en
satin
blanc
avec
des
noeuds
roses
mais
dès
que
steiner
consentait
elle
exigeait
largent
que
ça
coûterait
pour
le
manger
elle
avait
eu
seulement
le
caprice
dune
peau
de
tigre
devant
la
cheminée
et
dune
veilleuse
de
cristal
pendue
au
plafond
moi
je
nai
pas
sommeil
je
ne
couche
pas
ditelle
lorsquils
se
furent
enfermés
le
comte
lui
obéissait
avec
une
soumission
dhomme
qui
ne
craint
plus
dêtre
vu
son
unique
souci
était
de
ne
pas
la
fâcher
comme
tu
voudras
murmuratil
pourtant
il
retira
encore
ses
bottines
avant
de
sasseoir
devant
le
feu
un
des
plaisirs
de
nana
était
de
se
déshabiller
en
face
de
son
armoire
à
glace
où
elle
se
voyait
en
pied
elle
faisait
tomber
jusqu
à
sa
chemise
puis
toute
nue
elle
soubliait
elle
se
regardait
longuement
cétait
une
passion
de
son
corps
un
ravissement
du
satin
de
sa
peau
et
de
la
ligne
souple
de
sa
taille
qui
la
tenait
sérieuse
attentive
absorbée
dans
un
amour
dellemême
souvent
le
coiffeur
la
trouvait
ainsi
sans
quelle
tournât
la
tête
alors
muffat
se
fâchait
et
elle
restait
surprise
que
lui
prenaitil
ce
nétait
pas
pour
les
autres
cétait
pour
elle
ce
soirlà
voulant
se
mieux
voir
elle
alluma
les
six
bougies
des
appliques
mais
comme
elle
laissait
glisser
sa
chemise
elle
sarrêta
préoccupée
depuis
un
moment
ayant
une
question
au
bord
des
lèvres
tu
nas
pas
lu
larticle
du
figaro
le
journal
est
sur
la
table
le
rire
de
daguenet
lui
revenait
à
la
mémoire
elle
était
travaillée
dun
doute
si
ce
fauchery
lavait
débinée
elle
se
vengerait
prétend
quil
sagit
de
moi
làdedans
repritelle
en
affectant
un
air
dindifférence
hein
chéri
quelle
est
ton
idée
et
lâchant
la
chemise
attendant
que
muffat
eût
fini
sa
lecture
elle
resta
nue
muffat
lisait
lentement
la
chronique
de
fauchery
intitulée
la
mouche
dor
était
lhistoire
dune
fille
née
de
quatre
ou
cinq
générations
divrognes
le
sang
gâté
par
une
longue
hérédité
de
misère
et
de
boisson
qui
se
transformait
chez
elle
en
un
détraquement
nerveux
de
son
sexe
de
femme
elle
avait
poussé
dans
un
faubourg
sur
le
pavé
parisien
et
grande
belle
de
chair
superbe
ainsi
quune
plante
de
plein
fumier
elle
vengeait
les
gueux
et
les
abandonnés
dont
elle
était
le
produit
avec
elle
la
pourriture
quon
laissait
fermenter
dans
le
peuple
remontait
et
pourrissait
laristocratie
elle
devenait
une
force
de
la
nature
un
ferment
de
destruction
sans
le
vouloir
ellemême
corrompant
et
désorganisant
paris
entre
ses
cuisses
de
neige
le
faisant
tourner
comme
des
femmes
chaque
mois
font
tourner
le
lait
et
cétait
à
la
fin
de
larticle
que
se
trouvait
la
comparaison
de
la
mouche
une
mouche
couleur
de
soleil
envolée
de
lordure
une
mouche
qui
prenait
la
mort
sur
les
charognes
tolérées
le
long
des
chemins
et
qui
bourdonnante
dansante
jetant
un
éclat
de
pierreries
empoisonnait
les
hommes
rien
qu
à
se
poser
sur
eux
dans
les
palais
où
elle
entrait
par
les
fenêtres
muffat
leva
la
tête
les
yeux
fixes
regardant
le
feu
eh
bien
demanda
nana
mais
il
ne
répondit
pas
il
parut
vouloir
relire
la
chronique
une
sensation
de
froid
coulait
de
son
crâne
sur
ses
épaules
cette
chronique
était
écrite
à
la
diable
avec
des
cabrioles
de
phrases
une
outrance
de
mots
imprévus
et
de
rapprochements
baroques
cependant
il
restait
frappé
par
sa
lecture
qui
brusquement
venait
déveiller
en
lui
tout
ce
quil
naimait
point
à
remuer
depuis
quelques
mois
alors
il
leva
les
yeux
nana
sétait
absorbée
dans
son
ravissement
dellemême
elle
pliait
le
cou
regardant
avec
attention
dans
la
glace
un
petit
signe
brun
quelle
avait
audessus
de
la
hanche
droite
et
elle
le
touchait
du
bout
du
doigt
elle
le
faisait
saillir
en
se
renversant
davantage
le
trouvant
sans
doute
drôle
et
joli
à
cette
place
puis
elle
étudia
dautres
parties
de
son
corps
amusée
reprise
de
ses
curiosités
vicieuses
denfant
ça
la
surprenait
toujours
de
se
voir
elle
avait
lair
étonné
et
séduit
dune
jeune
fille
qui
découvre
sa
puberté
lentement
elle
ouvrit
les
bras
pour
développer
son
torse
de
vénus
grasse
elle
ploya
la
taille
sexaminant
de
dos
et
de
face
sarrêtant
au
profil
de
sa
gorge
aux
rondeurs
fuyantes
de
ses
cuisses
et
elle
finit
par
se
plaire
au
singulier
jeu
de
se
balancer
à
droite
à
gauche
les
genoux
écartés
la
taille
roulant
sur
les
reins
avec
le
frémissement
continu
dune
almée
dansant
la
danse
du
ventre
muffat
la
contemplait
elle
lui
faisait
peur
le
journal
était
tombé
de
ses
mains
dans
cette
minute
de
vision
nette
il
se
méprisait
cétait
cela
en
trois
mois
elle
avait
corrompu
sa
vie
il
se
sentait
déjà
gâté
jusquaux
moelles
par
des
ordures
quil
naurait
pas
soupçonnées
tout
allait
pourrir
en
lui
à
cette
heure
il
eut
un
instant
conscience
des
accidents
du
mal
il
vit
la
désorganisation
apportée
par
ce
ferment
lui
empoisonné
sa
famille
détruite
un
coin
de
société
qui
craquait
et
seffondrait
et
ne
pouvant
détourner
les
yeux
il
la
regardait
fixement
il
tâchait
de
semplir
du
dégoût
de
sa
nudité
nana
ne
bougea
plus
un
bras
derrière
la
nuque
une
main
prise
dans
lautre
elle
renversait
la
tête
les
coudes
écartés
il
voyait
en
raccourci
ses
yeux
demiclos
sa
bouche
entrouverte
son
visage
noyé
dun
rire
amoureux
et
parderrière
son
chignon
de
cheveux
jaunes
dénoué
lui
couvrait
le
dos
dun
poil
de
lionne
ployée
et
le
flanc
tendu
elle
montrait
les
reins
solides
la
gorge
dure
dune
guerrière
aux
muscles
forts
sous
le
grain
satiné
de
la
peau
une
ligne
fine
à
peine
ondée
par
lépaule
et
la
hanche
filait
dun
de
ses
coudes
à
son
pied
muffat
suivait
ce
profil
si
tendre
ces
fuites
de
chair
blonde
se
noyant
dans
des
lueurs
dorées
ces
rondeurs
où
la
flamme
des
bougies
mettait
des
reflets
de
soie
il
songeait
à
son
ancienne
horreur
de
la
femme
au
monstre
de
lécriture
lubrique
sentant
le
fauve
nana
était
toute
velue
un
duvet
de
rousse
faisait
de
son
corps
un
velours
tandis
que
dans
sa
croupe
et
ses
cuisses
de
cavale
dans
les
renflements
charnus
creusés
de
plis
profonds
qui
donnaient
au
sexe
le
voile
troublant
de
leur
ombre
il
avait
de
la
bête
cétait
la
bête
dor
inconsciente
comme
une
force
et
dont
lodeur
seule
gâtait
le
monde
muffat
regardait
toujours
obsédé
possédé
au
point
quayant
fermé
les
paupières
pour
ne
plus
voir
lanimal
reparut
au
fond
des
ténèbres
grandi
terrible
exagérant
sa
posture
maintenant
il
serait
là
devant
ses
yeux
dans
sa
chair
à
jamais
mais
nana
se
pelotonnait
sur
ellemême
un
frisson
de
tendresse
semblait
avoir
passé
dans
ses
membres
les
yeux
mouillés
elle
se
faisait
petite
comme
pour
se
mieux
sentir
puis
elle
dénoua
les
mains
les
abaissa
le
long
delle
par
un
glissement
jusquaux
seins
quelle
écrasa
dune
étreinte
nerveuse
et
rengorgée
se
fondant
dans
une
caresse
de
tout
son
corps
elle
se
frotta
les
joues
à
droite
à
gauche
contre
ses
épaules
avec
câlinerie
sa
bouche
goulue
soufflait
sur
elle
le
désir
elle
allongea
les
lèvres
elle
se
baisa
longuement
près
de
laisselle
en
riant
à
lautre
nana
qui
elle
aussi
se
baisait
dans
la
glace
alors
muffat
eut
un
soupir
bas
et
prolongé
ce
plaisir
solitaire
lexaspérait
brusquement
tout
fut
emporté
en
lui
comme
par
un
grand
vent
il
prit
nana
à
braslecorps
dans
un
élan
de
brutalité
et
la
jeta
sur
le
tapis
laissemoi
criatelle
tu
fais
du
mal
il
avait
conscience
de
sa
défaite
il
la
savait
stupide
ordurière
et
menteuse
et
il
la
voulait
même
empoisonnée
oh
cest
bête
ditelle
furieuse
quand
il
la
laissa
se
relever
pourtant
elle
se
calma
maintenant
il
sen
irait
après
avoir
passé
une
chemise
de
nuit
garnie
de
dentelle
elle
vint
sasseoir
par
terre
devant
le
feu
cétait
sa
place
favorite
comme
elle
le
questionnait
de
nouveau
sur
la
chronique
de
fauchery
muffat
répondit
vaguement
désireux
déviter
une
scène
dailleurs
elle
déclara
quelle
avait
fauchery
quelque
part
puis
elle
tomba
dans
un
long
silence
réfléchissant
au
moyen
de
renvoyer
le
comte
elle
aurait
voulu
une
manière
aimable
car
elle
restait
bonne
fille
et
ça
lennuyait
de
faire
de
la
peine
aux
gens
dautant
plus
que
celuilà
était
cocu
idée
qui
avait
fini
par
lattendrir
alors
ditelle
enfin
cest
demain
matin
que
tu
attends
ta
femme
muffat
sétait
allongé
dans
le
fauteuil
lair
assoupi
les
membres
las
il
dit
oui
dun
signe
nana
le
regardait
sérieuse
avec
un
sourd
travail
de
tête
assise
sur
une
cuisse
dans
le
chiffonnage
léger
de
ses
dentelles
elle
tenait
lun
de
ses
pieds
nus
entre
ses
deux
mains
et
machinalement
elle
le
tournait
le
retournait
il
longtemps
que
tu
es
marié
demandatelle
dixneuf
ans
répondit
le
comte
ah
et
ta
femme
estelle
aimable
faitesvous
bon
ménage
ensemble
il
se
tut
puis
dun
air
gêné
tu
sais
que
je
tai
priée
de
ne
jamais
parler
de
ces
choses
tiens
pourquoi
donc
criatelle
se
vexant
déjà
je
ne
la
mangerai
pas
ta
femme
bien
sûr
pour
parler
delle
mon
cher
toutes
les
femmes
se
valent
mais
elle
sarrêta
de
peur
den
trop
dire
seulement
elle
prit
un
air
supérieur
parce
quelle
se
croyait
très
bonne
ce
pauvre
homme
il
fallait
le
ménager
dailleurs
une
idée
gaie
lui
était
venue
elle
souriait
en
lexaminant
elle
reprit
dis
donc
je
ne
tai
pas
conté
lhistoire
que
fauchery
fait
courir
sur
toi
en
voilà
une
vipère
je
ne
lui
en
veux
pas
puisque
son
article
est
possible
mais
cest
une
vraie
vipère
tout
de
même
et
riant
plus
fort
lâchant
son
pied
elle
se
traîna
et
vint
appuyer
sa
gorge
contre
les
genoux
du
comte
imaginetoi
il
jure
que
tu
lavais
encore
lorsque
tu
épousé
ta
femme
hein
tu
lavais
encore
hein
estce
vrai
elle
le
pressait
du
regard
elle
avait
remonté
les
mains
jusqu
à
ses
épaules
et
le
secouait
pour
lui
arracher
cette
confession
sans
doute
réponditil
enfin
dun
ton
grave
alors
elle
sabattit
de
nouveau
à
ses
pieds
dans
une
crise
de
fou
rire
bégayant
lui
donnant
des
tapes
non
cest
impayable
il
n
que
toi
tu
es
un
phénomène
mais
mon
pauvre
chien
tu
dû
être
dun
bête
quand
un
homme
ne
sait
pas
cest
toujours
si
drôle
par
exemple
jaurais
voulu
vous
voir
et
ça
sest
bien
passé
raconte
un
peu
oh
je
ten
prie
raconte
elle
laccabla
de
questions
demandant
tout
exigeant
les
détails
et
elle
riait
si
bien
avec
de
brusques
éclats
qui
la
faisaient
se
tordre
la
chemise
glissée
et
retroussée
la
peau
dorée
par
le
grand
feu
que
le
comte
peu
à
peu
lui
conta
sa
nuit
de
noces
il
néprouvait
plus
aucun
malaise
cela
finissait
par
lamuser
luimême
dexpliquer
selon
lexpression
convenable
comment
il
lavait
perdu
il
choisissait
seulement
les
mots
par
un
reste
de
honte
la
jeune
femme
lancée
linterrogea
sur
la
comtesse
elle
était
merveilleusement
faite
mais
un
vrai
glaçon
à
ce
quil
prétendait
oh
va
murmuratil
lâchement
tu
nas
pas
à
être
jalouse
nana
avait
cessé
de
rire
elle
reprit
sa
place
le
dos
au
feu
ramenant
de
ses
deux
mains
jointes
ses
genoux
sous
le
menton
et
sérieuse
elle
déclara
mon
cher
ça
ne
vaut
rien
davoir
lair
godiche
devant
sa
femme
le
premier
soir
pourquoi
demanda
le
comte
surpris
parce
que
réponditelle
lentement
dun
air
doctoral
elle
professait
elle
hochait
la
tête
cependant
elle
daigna
sexpliquer
plus
clairement
voistu
moi
je
sais
comment
ça
se
passe
eh
bien
mon
petit
les
femmes
naiment
pas
quon
soit
bête
elles
ne
disent
rien
parce
quil
la
pudeur
tu
comprends
mais
sois
sûr
quelles
en
pensent
joliment
long
et
tôt
ou
tard
quand
n
pas
su
elles
vont
sarranger
ailleurs
voilà
mon
loup
il
semblait
ne
pas
comprendre
alors
elle
précisa
elle
se
faisait
maternelle
elle
lui
donnait
cette
leçon
en
camarade
par
bonté
de
coeur
depuis
quelle
le
savait
cocu
ce
secret
la
gênait
elle
avait
une
envie
folle
de
causer
de
ça
avec
lui
mon
dieu
je
parle
de
choses
qui
ne
regardent
pas
ce
que
jen
dis
cest
parce
que
tout
le
monde
devrait
être
heureux
nous
causons
nestce
pas
voyons
tu
vas
répondre
bien
franchement
mais
elle
sinterrompit
pour
changer
de
position
elle
se
brûlait
hein

joliment
chaud
jai
le
dos
cuit
attends
je
vais
cuire
un
peu
le
ventre
cest
ça
qui
est
bon
pour
les
douleurs
et
quand
elle
se
fut
tournée
la
gorge
au
feu
les
pieds
repliés
sous
les
cuisses
voyons
tu
ne
couches
plus
avec
ta
femme

te
le
jure
dit
muffat
craignant
une
scène
et
tu
crois
que
cest
un
vrai
morceau
de
bois
il
répondit
affirmativement
en
baissant
le
menton
et
cest
pour
ça
que
tu
maimes
réponds
donc
je
ne
fâcherai
pas
il
répéta
le
même
signe
très
bien
conclutelle
je
men
doutais
ah

pauvre
chien

connais
tante
lerat
quand
elle
viendra

fruitier

fruitier

feu

faut
que

le
côté
gauche
maintenant
en
présentant
la
hanche
à
la
flamme
une
drôlerie
lui
vint
et
elle
se
blagua
ellemême
en
bonne
bête
heureuse
de
se
voir
si
grasse
et
si
rose
dans
le
reflet
du
brasier
hein
jai
lair
dune
oie
oh

une
oie
à
la
broche

cuis
dans
mon
jus
elle
était
reprise
dun
beau
rire
lorsquil
eut
un
bruit
de
voix
et
de
portes
battantes
muffat
étonné
linterrogea
du
regard
elle
redevint
sérieuse
lair
inquiet
cétait
pour
sûr
le
chat
de
zoé
un
sacré
animal
qui
cassait
tout
minuit
et
demi
où
avaitelle
lidée
de
travailler
au
bonheur
de
son
cocu
présent
que
lautre
était
là
il
fallait
lexpédier
et
vite
que
disaistu
demanda
le
comte
avec
complaisance
ravi
de
la
voir
si
gentille
mais
dans
son
désir
de
le
renvoyer
sautant
à
une
autre
humeur
elle
fut
brutale
ne
ménageant
plus
les
mots
ah
oui
le
fruitier
et
sa
femme
eh
bien
mon
cher
ils
ne
se
sont
jamais
touchés
pas
ça
elle
était
très
portée
làdessus
tu
comprends
lui
godiche
n
pas
su
si
bien
que
la
croyant
en
bois
il
est
allé
ailleurs
avec
des
roulures
qui
lont
régalé
de
toutes
sortes
dhorreurs
tandis
quelle
de
son
côté
sen
payait
daussi
raides
avec
des
garçons
plus
malins
que

cornichon
de

et
ça
tourne
toujours
comme
ça

de
sentendre
je
le
sais
bien
moi
muffat
pâlissant
comprenant
enfin
les
allusions
voulut
la
faire
taire
mais
elle
était
lancée
non
fichemoi
la
paix
si
vous
nétiez
pas
des
mufes
vous
seriez
aussi
gentils
chez
vos
femmes
que
chez
nous
et
si
vos
femmes
nétaient
pas
des
dindes
elles
se
donneraient
pour
vous
garder
la
peine
que
nous
prenons
pour
vous
avoir

ça
cest

voilà
mon
petit
mets
ça
dans
ta
poche
ne
parlez
donc
pas
des
honnêtes
femmes
ditil
durement
vous
ne
les
connaissez
pas
du
coup
nana
se
releva
sur
les
genoux
je
ne
les
connais
pas
mais
elles
ne
sont
seulement
pas
propres
tes
femmes
honnêtes
non
elles
ne
sont
pas
propres
je
te

avec
tes
femmes
honnêtes
ne
pousse
pas
à
bout
ne
force
pas
à
te
dire
des
choses
que
je
regretterais
ensuite
le
comte
pour
toute
réponse
mâcha
sourdement
une
injure
son
tour
nana
devint
blanche
elle
le
regarda
quelques
secondes
sans
parler
puis
de
sa
voix
nette
que
feraistu
si
ta
femme
te
trompait
il
eut
un
geste
menaçant
eh
bien
et
moi
si
je
te
trompais
oh
toi
murmuratil
avec
un
haussement
dépaules
certes
nana
nétait
pas
méchante
depuis
les
premiers
mots
elle
résistait
à
lenvie
de
lui
envoyer
son
cocuage
par
la
figure
elle
aurait
aimé
le
confesser
làdessus
tranquillement
mais
à
la
fin
il
lexaspérait
ça
devait
finir
alors
mon
petit
repritelle
je
ne
sais
pas
ce
que
tu
fiches
chez
moi
tu
massommes
depuis
deux
heures
va
donc
retrouver
ta
femme
qui
fait
ça
avec
fauchery
oui
tout
juste
rue
taitbout
au
coin
de
la
rue
de
provence
je
te
donne
ladresse
tu
vois
puis
triomphante
voyant
muffat
se
mettre
debout
avec
le
vacillement
dun
boeuf
assommé
si
les
femmes
honnêtes
sen
mêlent
et
nous
prennent
nos
amants
vrai
elles
vont
bien
les
femmes
honnêtes
mais
elle
ne
put
continuer
dun
mouvement
terrible
il
lavait
jetée
par
terre
de
toute
sa
longueur
et
levant
le
talon
il
voulait
lui
écraser
la
tête
pour
la
faire
taire
un
instant
elle
eut
une
peur
affreuse
aveuglé
comme
fou
il
sétait
mis
à
battre
la
chambre
alors
le
silence
étranglé
quil
gardait
la
lutte
dont
il
était
secoué
la
touchèrent
jusquaux
larmes
elle
éprouvait
un
regret
mortel
et
se
pelotonnant
devant
le
feu
pour
se
cuire
le
côté
droit
elle
entreprit
de
le
consoler
je
te
jure
chéri
je
croyais
que
tu
le
savais
sans
cela
je
naurais
pas
parlé
bien
sûr
puis
ce
nest
pas
vrai
peutêtre
moi
je
naffirme
rien
dit
ça
le
monde
en
cause
mais
questce
que
ça
prouve
ah
va
tu
bien
tort
de
te
faire
de
la
bile
si
jétais
homme
cest
moi
qui
ficherais
des
femmes
les
femmes
voistu
en
haut
comme
en
bas
ça
se
vaut
toutes
noceuses
et
compagnie
elle
tapait
sur
les
femmes
par
abnégation
voulant
lui
rendre
le
coup
moins
cruel
mais
il
ne
lécoutait
pas
ne
lentendait
pas
tout
en
piétinant
il
avait
remis
ses
bottines
et
sa
redingote
un
moment
encore
il
battit
la
pièce
puis
dans
un
dernier
élan
comme
sil
trouvait
enfin
la
porte
il
se
sauva
nana
fut
très
vexée
eh
bien
bon
voyage
continuatelle
tout
haut
quoique
seule
il
est
encore
poli
celuilà
quand
lui
parle
et
moi
qui
mescrimais
je
suis
revenue
la
première
jai
assez
fait
dexcuses
je
crois
aussi
il
était
là
à
magacer
pourtant
elle
restait
mécontente
se
grattant
les
jambes
à
deux
mains
mais
elle
en
prit
son
parti
ah
zut
ce
nest
pas
faute
sil
est
cocu
et
cuite
de
tous
les
côtés
chaude
comme
une
caille
elle
alla
se
fourrer
dans
son
lit
en
sonnant
zoé
pour
quelle
fit
entrer
lautre
qui
attendait
à
la
cuisine
dehors
muffat
marcha
violemment
une
nouvelle
averse
venait
de
tomber
il
glissait
sur
le
pavé
gras
comme
il
regardait
en
lair
dun
mouvement
machinal
il
vit
des
haillons
de
nuages
couleur
de
suie
qui
couraient
devant
la
lune
cette
heure
sur
le
boulevard
haussmann
les
passants
se
faisaient
rares
il
longea
les
chantiers
de
lopéra
cherchant
le
noir
bégayant
des
mots
sans
suite
cette
fille
mentait
elle
avait
inventé
ça
par
bêtise
et
cruauté
il
aurait
dû
lui
écraser
la
tête
lorsquil
la
tenait
sous
son
talon
la
fin
cétait
trop
de
honte
jamais
il
ne
la
reverrait
jamais
il
ne
la
toucherait
ou
il
faudrait
quil
fût
bien
lâche
et
il
respirait
fortement
dun
air
de
délivrance
ah
ce
monstre
nu
stupide
cuisant
comme
une
oie
bavant
sur
tout
ce
quil
respectait
depuis
quarante
années
la
lune
sétait
découverte
une
nappe
blanche
baigna
la
rue
déserte
il
eut
peur
et
il
éclata
en
sanglots
tout
dun
coup
désespéré
affolé
comme
tombé
dans
un
vide
immense
mon
dieu
balbutiatil
cest
fini
il
n
plus
rien
le
long
des
boulevards
des
gens
attardés
hâtaient
le
pas
il
tâcha
de
se
calmer
lhistoire
de
cette
fille
recommençait
toujours
dans
sa
tête
en
feu
il
aurait
voulu
raisonner
les
faits
cétait
le
matin
que
la
comtesse
devait
revenir
du
château
de
madame
de
chezelles
rien
en
effet
ne
laurait
empêchée
de
rentrer
à
paris
la
veille
au
soir
et
de
passer
la
nuit
chez
cet
homme
il
se
rappelait
maintenant
certains
détails
de
leur
séjour
aux
fondettes
un
soir
il
avait
surpris
sabine
sous
les
arbres
si
émue
quelle
ne
pouvait
répondre
lhomme
était
là
pourquoi
ne
seraitelle
pas
chez
lui
maintenant
mesure
quil
pensait
lhistoire
devenait
possible
il
finit
par
la
trouver
naturelle
et
nécessaire
tandis
quil
se
mettait
en
manches
de
chemise
chez
une
catin
sa
femme
se
déshabillait
dans
la
chambre
dun
amant
rien
de
plus
simple
ni
de
plus
logique
et
en
raisonnant
ainsi
il
sefforçait
de
rester
froid
cétait
une
sensation
de
chute
dans
la
folie
de
la
chair
sélargissant
gagnant
et
emportant
le
monde
autour
de
lui
des
images
chaudes
le
poursuivaient
nana
nue
brusquement
évoqua
sabine
nue
cette
vision
qui
les
rapprochait
dans
une
parenté
dimpudeur
sous
un
même
souffle
de
désir
il
trébucha
sur
la
chaussée
un
fiacre
avait
failli
lécraser
des
femmes
sorties
dun
café
le
coudoyaient
avec
des
rires
alors
gagné
de
nouveau
par
les
larmes
malgré
son
effort
ne
voulant
pas
sangloter
devant
les
gens
il
se
jeta
dans
une
rue
noire
et
vide
la
rue
rossini
où
le
long
des
maisons
silencieuses
il
pleura
comme
un
enfant
cest
fini
disaitil
dune
voix
sourde
il
n
plus
rien
il
n
plus
rien
il
pleurait
si
violemment
quil
sadossa
contre
une
porte
le
visage
dans
ses
mains
mouillées
un
bruit
de
pas
le
chassa
il
éprouvait
une
honte
une
peur
qui
le
faisait
fuir
devant
le
monde
avec
la
marche
inquiète
dun
rôdeur
de
nuit
quand
des
passants
le
croisaient
sur
le
trottoir
il
tâchait
de
prendre
une
allure
dégagée
en
simaginant
quon
lisait
son
histoire
dans
le
balancement
de
ses
épaules
il
avait
suivi
la
rue
de
la
grangebatelière
jusqu
à
la
rue
du
faubourgmontmartre
léclat
des
lumières
le
surprit
il
revint
sur
ses
pas
pendant
près
dune
heure
il
courut
ainsi
le
quartier
choisissant
les
trous
les
plus
sombres
il
avait
sans
doute
un
où
ses
pieds
allaient
deuxmêmes
patiemment
par
un
chemin
sans
cesse
compliqué
de
détours
enfin
au
coude
dune
rue
il
leva
les
yeux
il
était
arrivé
cétait
le
coin
de
la
rue
taitbout
et
de
la
rue
de
provence
il
avait
mis
une
heure
pour
venir
là
dans
le
grondement
douloureux
de
son
cerveau
lorsquen
cinq
minutes
il
aurait
pu
rendre
un
matin
le
mois
dernier
il
se
souvenait
dêtre
monté
chez
fauchery
le
remercier
dune
chronique
sur
un
bal
des
tuileries
où
le
journaliste
lavait
nommé
lappartement
se
trouvait
à
lentresol
de
petites
fenêtres
carrées
à
demi
cachées
derrière
lenseigne
colossale
dune
boutique
vers
la
gauche
la
dernière
fenêtre
était
coupée
par
une
bande
de
vive
clarté
un
rayon
de
lampe
qui
passait
entre
les
rideaux
entrouverts
et
il
resta
les
yeux
fixés
sur
cette
raie
lumineuse
absorbé
attendant
quelque
chose
la
lune
avait
disparu
dans
un
ciel
dencre
doù
tombait
une
bruine
glacée
deux
heures
sonnèrent
à
la
trinité
la
rue
de
provence
et
la
rue
taitbout
senfonçaient
avec
les
taches
vives
des
becs
de
gaz
qui
se
noyaient
au
loin
dans
une
vapeur
jaune
muffat
ne
bougeait
pas
cétait
la
chambre
il
se
la
rappelait
tendue
dandrinople
rouge
avec
un
lit
louis
xiii
au
fond
la
lampe
devait
être
à
droite
sur
la
cheminée
sans
doute
ils
étaient
couchés
car
pas
une
ombre
ne
passait
la
raie
de
clarté
luisait
immobile
comme
un
reflet
de
veilleuse
et
lui
les
yeux
toujours
levés
faisait
un
plan
il
sonnait
il
montait
malgré
les
appels
du
concierge
enfonçait
les
portes
à
coups
dépaule
tombait
sur
eux
dans
le
lit
sans
leur
donner
le
temps
de
dénouer
leurs
bras
un
instant
lidée
quil
navait
pas
darme
larrêta
puis
il
décida
quil
les
étranglerait
il
reprenait
son
plan
il
le
perfectionnait
attendant
toujours
quelque
chose
un
indice
pour
être
certain
si
une
ombre
de
femme
sétait
montrée
à
ce
moment
il
aurait
sonné
mais
la
pensée
quil
se
trompait
peutêtre
le
glaçait
que
diraitil
des
doutes
lui
revenaient
sa
femme
ne
pouvait
être
chez
cet
homme
cétait
monstrueux
et
impossible
cependant
il
demeurait
envahi
peu
à
peu
par
un
engourdissement
glissant
à
une
mollesse
dans
cette
longue
attente
que
la
fixité
de
son
regard
hallucinait
une
averse
tomba
deux
sergents
de
ville
approchaient
et
il
dut
quitter
le
coin
de
porte
où
il
sétait
réfugié
lorsquils
se
furent
perdus
dans
la
rue
de
provence
il
revint
mouillé
frissonnant
la
raie
lumineuse
barrait
toujours
la
fenêtre
cette
fois
il
allait
partir
quand
une
ombre
passa
ce
fut
si
rapide
quil
crut
sêtre
trompé
mais
coup
sur
coup
dautres
taches
coururent
toute
une
agitation
eut
lieu
dans
la
chambre
lui
cloué
de
nouveau
sur
le
trottoir
éprouvait
une
sensation
intolérable
de
brûlure
à
lestomac
attendant
pour
comprendre
maintenant
des
profils
de
bras
et
de
jambes
fuyaient
une
main
énorme
voyageait
avec
une
silhouette
de
pot
à
eau
il
ne
distinguait
rien
nettement
pourtant
il
lui
semblait
reconnaître
un
chignon
de
femme
et
il
discuta
aurait
dit
la
coiffure
de
sabine
seulement
la
nuque
paraissait
trop
forte
cette
heure
il
ne
savait
plus
il
ne
pouvait
plus
son
estomac
le
faisait
tellement
souffrir
dans
une
angoisse
dincertitude
affreuse
quil
se
serrait
contre
la
porte
pour
se
calmer
avec
le
grelottement
dun
pauvre
puis
comme
malgré
tout
il
ne
détournait
pas
les
yeux
de
cette
fenêtre
sa
colère
se
fondit
dans
une
imagination
de
moraliste
il
se
voyait
député
il
parlait
à
une
assemblée
tonnait
contre
la
débauche
annonçait
des
catastrophes
et
il
refaisait
larticle
de
fauchery
sur
la
mouche
empoisonnée
et
il
se
mettait
en
scène
en
déclarant
quil
n
avait
plus
de
société
possible
avec
ces
moeurs
de
basempire
cela
lui
fit
du
bien
mais
les
ombres
avaient
disparu
sans
doute
ils
sétaient
recouchés
lui
regardait
toujours
attendait
encore
trois
heures
sonnèrent
puis
quatre
heures
il
ne
pouvait
partir
quand
des
averses
tombaient
il
senfonçait
dans
le
coin
de
la
porte
les
jambes
éclaboussées
personne
ne
passait
plus
par
moments
ses
yeux
se
fermaient
comme
brûlés
par
la
raie
de
lumière
sur
laquelle
ils
sentêtaient
fixement
avec
une
obstination
imbécile
deux
nouvelles
reprises
les
ombres
coururent
répétant
les
mêmes
gestes
promenant
le
même
profil
dun
pot
à
eau
gigantesque
et
deux
fois
le
calme
se
rétablit
la
lampe
jeta
sa
lueur
discrète
de
veilleuse
ces
ombres
augmentaient
son
doute
dailleurs
une
idée
soudaine
venait
de
lapaiser
en
reculant
lheure
dagir
il
navait
qu
à
attendre
la
femme
à
sa
sortie
il
reconnaîtrait
bien
sabine
rien
de
plus
simple
pas
de
scandale
et
une
certitude
il
suffisait
de
rester
là
de
tous
les
sentiments
confus
qui
lavaient
agité
il
ne
ressentait
maintenant
quun
sourd
besoin
de
savoir
mais
lennui
lendormait
sous
cette
porte
pour
se
distraire
il
tâcha
de
calculer
le
temps
quil
lui
faudrait
attendre
sabine
devait
se
trouver
à
la
gare
vers
neuf
heures
cela
lui
donnait
près
de
quatre
heures
et
demie
il
était
plein
de
patience
il
naurait
plus
remué
trouvant
un
charme
à
rêver
que
son
attente
dans
la
nuit
serait
éternelle
tout
dun
coup
la
raie
de
lumière
seffaça
ce
fait
très
simple
fut
pour
lui
une
catastrophe
inattendue
quelque
chose
de
désagréable
et
de
troublant
évidemment
ils
venaient
déteindre
la
lampe
ils
allaient
dormir
cette
heure
cétait
raisonnable
mais
il
sen
irrita
parce
que
cette
fenêtre
noire
à
présent
ne
lintéressait
plus
il
la
regarda
un
quart
dheure
encore
puis
elle
le
fatigua
il
quitta
la
porte
et
fit
quelques
pas
sur
le
trottoir
jusqu
à
cinq
heures
il
se
promena
allant
et
venant
levant
les
yeux
de
temps
à
autre
la
fenêtre
restait
morte
par
moments
il
se
demandait
sil
navait
pas
rêvé
que
des
ombres
dansaient
là
sur
ces
vitres
une
fatigue
immense
laccablait
une
hébétude
dans
laquelle
il
oubliait
ce
quil
attendait
à
ce
coin
de
rue
butant
contre
les
pavés
se
réveillant
en
sursaut
avec
le
frisson
glacé
dun
homme
qui
ne
sait
plus
où
il
est
rien
ne
valait
la
peine
quon
se
donnât
du
souci
puisque
ces
gens
dormaient
il
fallait
les
laisser
dormir
quoi
bon
se
mêler
de
leurs
affaires
il
faisait
très
noir
personne
ne
saurait
jamais
ces
choses
et
alors
tout
en
lui
jusqu
à
sa
curiosité
sen
alla
emporté
dans
une
envie
den
finir
de
chercher
quelque
part
un
soulagement
le
froid
augmentait
la
rue
lui
devenait
insupportable
deux
fois
il
séloigna
se
rapprocha
en
traînant
les
pieds
pour
séloigner
davantage
cétait
fini
il
n
avait
plus
rien
il
descendit
jusquau
boulevard
et
ne
revint
pas
ce
fut
une
course
morne
dans
les
rues
il
marchait
lentement
toujours
du
même
pas
suivant
les
murs
ses
talons
sonnaient
il
ne
voyait
que
son
ombre
tourner
en
grandissant
et
en
se
rapetissant
à
chaque
bec
de
gaz
cela
le
berçait
loccupait
mécaniquement
plus
tard
jamais
il
ne
sut
où
il
avait
passé
il
lui
semblait
sêtre
traîné
pendant
des
heures
en
rond
dans
un
cirque
un
souvenir
unique
lui
resta
très
net
sans
pouvoir
expliquer
comment
il
se
trouvait
le
visage
collé
à
la
grille
du
passage
des
panoramas
tenant
les
barreaux
des
deux
mains
il
ne
les
secouait
pas
il
tâchait
simplement
de
voir
dans
le
passage
pris
dune
émotion
dont
tout
son
coeur
était
gonflé
mais
il
ne
distinguait
rien
un
flot
de
ténèbres
coulait
le
long
de
la
galerie
déserte
le
vent
qui
sengouffrait
par
la
rue
saintmarc
lui
soufflait
au
visage
une
humidité
de
cave
et
il
sentêtait
puis
sortant
dun
rêve
il
demeura
étonné
il
se
demanda
ce
quil
cherchait
à
cette
heure
serré
contre
cette
grille
avec
une
telle
passion
que
les
barreaux
lui
étaient
entrés
dans
la
figure
alors
il
avait
repris
sa
marche
désespéré
le
coeur
empli
dune
dernière
tristesse
comme
trahi
et
seul
désormais
dans
toute
cette
ombre
le
jour
enfin
se
leva
ce
petit
jour
sale
des
nuits
dhiver
si
mélancolique
sur
le
pavé
boueux
de
paris
muffat
était
revenu
dans
les
larges
rues
en
construction
qui
longeaient
les
chantiers
du
nouvel
opéra
trempé
par
les
averses
défoncé
par
les
chariots
le
sol
plâtreux
était
changé
en
un
lac
de
fange
et
sans
regarder
où
il
posait
les
pieds
il
marchait
toujours
glissant
se
rattrapant
le
réveil
de
paris
les
équipes
de
balayeurs
et
les
premières
bandes
douvriers
lui
apportaient
un
nouveau
trouble
à
mesure
que
le
jour
grandissait
le
regardait
avec
surprise
le
chapeau
noyé
deau
crotté
effaré
longtemps
il
se
réfugia
contre
les
palissades
parmi
les
échafaudages
dans
son
être
vide
une
seule
idée
restait
celle
quil
était
bien
misérable
alors
il
pensa
à
dieu
cette
idée
brusque
dun
secours
divin
dune
consolation
surhumaine
le
surprit
comme
une
chose
inattendue
et
singulière
elle
éveillait
en
lui
limage
de
venot
il
voyait
sa
petite
figure
grasse
ses
dents
gâtées
certainement
venot
quil
désolait
depuis
des
mois
en
évitant
de
le
voir
serait
bien
heureux
sil
allait
frapper
à
sa
porte
pour
pleurer
entre
ses
bras
autrefois
dieu
lui
gardait
toutes
ses
miséricordes
au
moindre
chagrin
au
moindre
obstacle
barrant
sa
vie
il
entrait
dans
une
église
sagenouillait
humiliait
son
néant
devant
la
souveraine
puissance
et
il
en
sortait
fortifié
par
la
prière
prêt
aux
abandons
des
biens
de
ce
monde
avec
lunique
désir
de
léternité
de
son
salut
mais
aujourdhui
il
ne
pratiquait
plus
que
par
secousses
aux
heures
où
la
terreur
de
lenfer
le
reprenait
toutes
sortes
de
mollesses
lavaient
envahi
nana
troublait
ses
devoirs
et
lidée
de
dieu
létonnait
pourquoi
navaitil
pas
songé
à
dieu
tout
de
suite
dans
cette
effroyable
crise
où
craquait
et
seffondrait
sa
faible
humanité
cependant
de
sa
marche
pénible
il
chercha
une
église
il
ne
se
souvenait
plus
lheure
matinale
lui
changeait
les
rues
puis
comme
il
tournait
un
coin
de
la
rue
de
la
chausséedantin
il
aperçut
au
bout
la
trinité
une
tour
vague
fondue
dans
le
brouillard
les
statues
blanches
dominant
le
jardin
dépouillé
semblaient
mettre
des
vénus
frileuses
parmi
les
feuilles
jaunies
dun
parc
sous
le
porche
il
souffla
un
instant
fatigué
par
la
montée
du
large
perron
puis
il
entra
léglise
était
très
froide
avec
son
calorifère
éteint
de
la
veille
ses
hautes
voûtes
emplies
dune
buée
fine
qui
avait
filtré
par
les
vitraux
une
ombre
noyait
les
bascôtés
pas
une
âme
nétait
là
entendait
seulement
au
fond
de
cette
nuit
louche
un
bruit
de
savate
quelque
bedeau
traînant
les
pieds
dans
la
maussaderie
du
réveil
lui
pourtant
après
sêtre
cogné
à
une
débandade
de
chaises
perdu
le
coeur
gros
de
larmes
était
tombé
à
genoux
contre
la
grille
dune
petite
chapelle
près
dun
bénitier
il
avait
joint
les
mains
il
cherchait
des
prières
tout
son
être
aspirait
à
se
donner
dans
un
élan
mais
ses
lèvres
seules
bégayaient
des
paroles
toujours
son
esprit
fuyait
retournait
dehors
se
remettait
en
marche
le
long
des
rues
sans
repos
comme
sous
le
fouet
dune
nécessité
implacable
et
il
répétait
mon
dieu
venez
à
mon
secours
mon
dieu
nabandonnez
pas
votre
créature
qui
sabandonne
à
votre
justice
mon
dieu
je
vous
adore
laisserezvous
périr
sous
les
coups
de
vos
ennemis
rien
ne
répondait
lombre
et
le
froid
lui
tombaient
sur
les
épaules
le
bruit
des
savates
au
loin
continuait
et
lempêchait
de
prier
il
nentendait
toujours
que
ce
bruit
irritant
dans
léglise
déserte
où
le
coup
de
balai
du
matin
nétait
pas
même
donné
avant
le
petit
échauffement
des
premières
messes
alors
saidant
dune
chaise
il
se
releva
avec
un
craquement
des
genoux
dieu
n
était
pas
encore
pourquoi
auraitil
pleuré
entre
les
bras
de
venot
cet
homme
ne
pouvait
rien
et
machinalement
il
retourna
chez
nana
dehors
ayant
glissé
il
sentit
des
larmes
lui
venir
aux
yeux
sans
colère
contre
le
sort
simplement
faible
et
malade
la
fin
il
était
trop
las
il
avait
reçu
trop
de
pluie
il
souffrait
trop
du
froid
lidée
de
rentrer
dans
son
hôtel
sombre
de
la
rue
miromesnil
le
glaçait
chez
nana
la
porte
nétait
pas
ouverte
il
dut
attendre
que
le
concierge
parût
en
montant
il
souriait
pénétré
déjà
par
la
chaleur
molle
de
cette
niche
où
il
allait
pouvoir
sétirer
et
dormir
lorsque
zoé
lui
ouvrit
elle
eut
un
geste
de
stupéfaction
et
dinquiétude
madame
prise
dune
abominable
migraine
navait
pas
fermé
loeil
enfin
elle
pouvait
toujours
voir
si
madame
ne
sétait
pas
endormie
et
elle
se
glissa
dans
la
chambre
pendant
quil
tombait
sur
un
fauteuil
du
salon
mais
presque
aussitôt
nana
parut
elle
sautait
du
lit
elle
avait
à
peine
eu
le
temps
de

jupon

et
déchirée
dans
le
désordre
dune
nuit

accourait
sous
le
fouet
de
la
colère
pour

porte
mais
en
le
voyant
si
minable

éprouva
un
dernier
apitoiement

savançait
vers
lui
menaçante
et
dans
cette
exaspération
dune
bonne
fille
poussée
à
bout
convaincue
de
son
droit
et
de
sa
supériorité
sur
les
honnêtes
gens
qui
lassommaient
brusquement
la
porte
souvrit
et
steiner
se
présenta
ce
fut
le
comble
elle
eut
une
exclamation
terrible
allons
voilà
lautre
steiner
ahuri
par
léclat
de
sa
voix
sétait
arrêté
la
présence
imprévue
de
muffat
le
contrariait
car
il
avait
peur
dune
explication
devant
laquelle
il
reculait
depuis
trois
mois
les
yeux
clignotants
il
se
dandinait
dun
air
gêné
en
évitant
de
regarder
le
comte
et
il
soufflait
avec
la
face
rouge
et
décomposée
dun
homme
qui
couru
paris
pour
apporter
une
bonne
nouvelle
et
qui
se
sent
tomber
dans
une
catastrophe
que

que

lui
trouvait
pas
mille
francs
pour
payer
un
billet
elle
ne
le
recevrait
plus
depuis
deux
jours
il
battait
le
pavé
enfin
il
venait
de
compléter
la
somme
le
matin
même
les
mille
francs
finitil
par
dire
en
tirant
de
sa
poche
une
enveloppe

mille
francs

le
cas
que

de
tes
mille
francs
et
prenant
lenveloppe
elle
la
lui
jeta
par
la
figure
en
juif
prudent
il
la
ramassa
péniblement
il
regardait
la
jeune
femme
hébété
muffat
échangea
avec
lui
un
regard
de
désespoir
pendant
quelle
se
mettait
les
poings
sur
les
hanches
pour
crier
plus
fort
ah
ça
avezvous
bientôt
fini
de
minsulter

mon
cher
je
suis
contente
que
tu
sois
venu
aussi
parce
que
voistu
le
balayage

être
complet
allons
houp
dehors
puis
comme
ils
ne
se
pressaient
guère
paralysés
hein
vous
dites
que
je
fais
une
sottise
possible
mais
vous
mavez
trop
embêtée
et
zut
jen
ai
assez
dêtre
chic
si
jen
crève
cest
mon
plaisir
ils
voulurent
la
calmer
ils
la
suppliaient
une
deux
vous
refusez
de
partir
eh
bien
voyez
ça
jai
du
monde
dun
geste
brusque
elle
ouvrit
toute
grande
la
porte
de
la
chambre
alors
les
deux
hommes
au
milieu
du
lit
défait
aperçurent
fontan
il
ne
sattendait
pas
à
être
montré
ainsi
et
il
avait
les
jambes
en
lair
la
chemise
volante
vautré
comme
un
bouc
au
milieu
des
dentelles
fripées
avec
sa
peau
noire
dailleurs
il
ne
se
troubla
pas
habitué
aux
surprises
des
planches
après
la
première
secousse
de
saisissement
il
trouva
un
jeu
de
physionomie
pour
sen
tirer
à
son
honneur
il
fit
le
lapin
comme
il
disait
avançant
la
bouche
frisant
le
nez
dans
un
remuement
du
museau
entier
sa
tête
de
faune
canaille
suait
le
vice
cétait
fontan
que
depuis
huit
jours
nana
allait
chercher
aux
variétés
prise
de
la
toquade
enragée
des
filles
pour
la
laideur
grimacière
des
comiques
voilà
ditelle
en
le
montrant
avec
un
geste
de
tragédienne
muffat
qui
avait
tout
accepté
se
révolta
sous
cet
affront
putain
bégayatil
mais
nana
déjà
dans
la
chambre
revint
pour
avoir
le
dernier
mot
de
quoi
putain
et
ta
femme
et
sen
allant
refermant
la
porte
à
toute
volée
elle
poussa
bruyamment
le
verrou
les
deux
hommes
restés
seuls
se
regardèrent
en
silence
zoé
venait
dentrer
mais
elle
ne
les
bouscula
pas
elle
leur
causa
très
raisonnablement
en
personne
sage
elle
trouvait
la
bêtise
de
madame
un
peu
forte
pourtant
elle
la
défendait
ça
ne
tiendrait
pas
avec
ce
cabotin
il
fallait
laisser
passer
cette
ragelà
les
deux
hommes
se
retirèrent
ils
navaient
pas
dit
une
parole
sur
le
trottoir
émus
par
une
fraternité
ils
se
donnèrent
une
poignée
de
main
silencieuse
et
se
tournant
le
dos
ils
séloignèrent
traînant
la
jambe
chacun
de
son
côté
lorsque
muffat
rentra
enfin
à
son
hôtel
de
la
rue
miromesnil
sa
femme
justement
arrivait
tous
deux
se
rencontrèrent
dans
le
vaste
escalier
dont
les
murs
sombres
laissaient
tomber
un
frisson
glacé
ils
levèrent
les
yeux
et
se
virent
le
comte
avait
encore
ses
vêtements
boueux
sa
pâleur
effarée
dhomme
qui
revient
du
vice
la
comtesse
comme
brisée
par
une
nuit
de
chemin
de
fer
dormait
debout
mal
repeignée
et
les
paupières
meurtries
viii
cétait
rue
véron
à
montmartre
dans
un
petit
logement
au
quatrième
étage
nana
et
fontan
avaient
invité
quelques
amis
pour
tirer
le
gâteau
des
rois
ils
pendaient
la
crémaillère
installés
seulement
depuis
trois
jours
ça
sétait
fait
brusquement
sans
idée
arrêtée
de
se
mettre
ensemble
dans
le
premier
feu
de
leur
lune
de
miel
le
lendemain
de
sa
belle
algarade
quand
elle
eut
flanqué
si
carrément
à
la
porte
le
comte
et
le
banquier
nana
sentit
tout
crouler
autour
delle
dun
regard
elle
jugea
la
situation
les
créanciers
allaient
tomber
dans
son
antichambre
se
mêler
de
ses
affaires
de
coeur
parler
de
tout
vendre
si
elle
nétait
pas
raisonnable
ce
seraient
des
querelles
des
cassements
de
tête
à
nen
plus
finir
pour
leur
disputer
ses
quatre
meubles
et
elle
préféra
tout
lâcher
dailleurs
lappartement
du
boulevard
haussmann
lassommait
il
était
bête
avec
ses
grandes
pièces
dorées
dans
son
coup
de
tendresse
pour
fontan
elle
rêvait
une
jolie
petite
chambre
claire
retournant
à
son
ancien
idéal
de
fleuriste
lorsquelle
ne
voyait
pas
audelà
dune
armoire
à
glace
en
palissandre
et
dun
lit
tendu
de
reps
bleu
en
deux
jours
elle
vendit
ce
quelle
put
sortir
des
bibelots
des
bijoux
et
elle
disparut
avec
une
dizaine
de
mille
francs
sans
dire
un
mot
à
la
concierge
un
plongeon
une
fugue
pas
une
trace
comme
ça
les
hommes
ne
viendraient
pas
se
pendre
après
ses
jupes
fontan
fut
très
gentil
il
ne
dit
pas
non
il
la
laissa
faire
même
il
agit
tout
à
fait
en
bon
camarade
de
son
côté
il
avait
près
de
sept
mille
francs
quil
consentit
à
joindre
aux
dix
mille
de
la
jeune
femme
bien
quon
laccusât
davarice
ça
leur
parut
un
fonds
de
ménage
solide
et
ils
partirent
de
là
tirant
lun
et
lautre
de
leurs
magots
mis
en
commun
louant
et
meublant
les
deux
pièces
de
la
rue
véron
partageant
tout
en
vieux
amis
au
début
ce
fut
vraiment
délicieux
le
soir
des
rois
madame
lerat
arriva
la
première
avec
louiset
comme
fontan
nétait
pas
rentré
elle
se
permit
dexprimer
des
craintes
car
elle
tremblait
de
voir
sa
nièce
renoncer
à
la
fortune
oh
tante
je
laime
si
fort
cria
nana
en
serrant
dun
geste
joli
ses
deux
mains
sur
sa
poitrine
ce
mot
produisit
un
effet
extraordinaire
sur
madame
lerat
ses
yeux
se
mouillèrent
ça
cest
vrai
ditelle
dun
air
de
conviction
lamour
avant
tout
et
elle
se
récria
sur
la
gentillesse
des
pièces
nana
lui
fit
visiter
la
chambre
la
salle
à
manger
jusqu
à
la
cuisine
dame
ce
nétait
pas
immense
mais
avait
refait
les
peintures
changé
les
papiers
et
le
soleil
entrait
là
gaiement
alors
madame
lerat
retint
la
jeune
femme
dans
la
chambre
tandis
que
louiset
sinstallait
à
la
cuisine
derrière
la
femme
de
ménage
pour
voir
rôtir
un
poulet
si
elle
se
permettait
des
réflexions
cétait
que
zoé
sortait
de
chez
elle
zoé
bravement
restait
sur
la
brèche
par
dévouement
pour
madame
plus
tard
madame
la
paierait
elle
nétait
pas
inquiète
et
dans
la
débâcle
de
lappartement
du
boulevard
haussmann
elle
tenait
tête
aux
créanciers
elle
opérait
une
retraite
digne
sauvant
des
épaves
répondant
que
madame
voyageait
sans
jamais
donner
une
adresse
même
de
peur
dêtre
suivie
elle
se
privait
du
plaisir
de
rendre
visite
à
madame
cependant
le
matin
elle
avait
couru
chez
madame
lerat
parce
quil
se
passait
du
nouveau
la
veille
des
créanciers
sétaient
présentés
le
tapissier
le
charbonnier
la
lingère
offrant
du
temps
proposant
même
davancer
une
très
forte
somme
à
madame
si
madame
voulait
revenir
dans
son
appartement
et
se
conduire
en
personne
intelligente
la
tante
répéta
les
paroles
de
zoé

avait
sans
doute
un
monsieur

déclara
nana
révoltée

que
de

cest
ce
que
jai
répondu
dit
madame
lerat
nièce
trop
de
coeur
nana
cependant
fut
très
vexée
dapprendre
quon
vendait
la
mignotte
et
que
labordette
lachetait
à
un
prix
ridicule
pour
caroline
héquet
ça
la
mit
en
colère
contre
cette
clique
de
vraies
roulures
malgré
leur
pose
ah
oui
par
exemple
elle
valait
mieux
quelles
toutes
elles
peuvent
blaguer
conclutelle
largent

leur
donnera
jamais
le
vrai
bonheur
et
puis
voistu
tante
je
ne
sais
même
plus
si
tout
ce
mondelà
existe
je
suis
trop
heureuse
justement
madame
maloir
entrait
avec
un
de
ces
chapeaux
étranges
dont
elle
seule
trouvait
la
forme
ce
fut
une
joie
de
se
revoir
madame
maloir
expliqua
que
les
grandeurs
lintimidaient
maintenant
de
temps
à
autre
elle
reviendrait
faire
son
bézigue
visita
une
seconde
fois
le
logement
et
dans
la
cuisine
devant
la
femme
de
ménage
qui
arrosait
le
poulet

parla
déconomies
dit
quune
bonne
aurait
coûté
trop
cher
et
quellemême
voulait
soccuper
de
son
chezelle
louiset
regardait
béatement
la
rôtissoire
mais
il
eut
un
éclat
de
voix
cétait
fontan
avec
bosc
et
prullière
pouvait
se
mettre
à
table
le
potage
était
déjà
servi
lorsque
nana
pour
la
troisième
fois
montra
le
logement
ah
mes
enfants
que
vous
êtes
bien
ici
répétait
bosc
histoire
simplement
de
faire
plaisir
aux
camarades
qui
payaient
à
dîner
car
au
fond
la
question
de
la
niche
comme
il
disait
ne
le
touchait
pas
dans
la
chambre
à
coucher
il
força
encore
la
note
aimable
dordinaire
il
traitait
les
femmes
de
chameaux
et
lidée
quun
homme
pouvait
sembarrasser
dune
de
ces
sales
bêtes
soulevait
chez
lui
la
seule
indignation
dont
il
était
capable
dans
le
dédain
divrogne
dont
il
enveloppait
le
monde
ah
les
gaillards
repritil
en
clignant
les
yeux
ils
ont
fait
ça
en
sournois
eh
bien
vrai
vous
avez
eu
raison
ce
sera
charmant
et
nous
viendrons
vous
voir
nom
de
dieu
mais
comme
louiset
arrivait
à
califourchon
sur
un
manche
à
balai
prullière
dit
avec
un
rire
méchant
tiens
cest
déjà
à
vous
ce
bébé
cela
parut
très
drôle
madame
lerat
et
madame
maloir
se
tordirent
nana
loin
de
se
fâcher
eut
un
rire
attendri
en
disant
que
non
malheureusement
elle
aurait
bien
voulu
pour
le
petit
et
pour
elle
mais
il
en
viendrait
peutêtre
un
tout
de
même
fontan
qui
faisait
le
bonhomme
prit
louiset
dans
ses
bras
jouant
zézayant
ça
nempêche
pas
aime
son

papa
bégayait
lenfant
tout
le

le
couvrit
de
caresses
bosc
embêté

de
se
mettre
à

il
n
avait
que
ça
de
sérieux
nana
demanda
la
permission
dasseoir
louiset
près
delle
le
dîner
fut
très
gai
bosc
pourtant
souffrit
du
voisinage
de
lenfant
contre
lequel
il
devait
défendre
son
assiette
madame
lerat
le
gêna
aussi
elle
sattendrissait
lui
communiquait
tout
bas
des
choses
mystérieuses
des
histoires
de
messieurs
très
bien
qui
la
poursuivaient
encore
et
à
deux
reprises
il
dut
écarter
son
genou
car
elle
lenvahissait
avec
des
yeux
noyés
prullière
se
conduisit
comme
un
malhonnête
à
légard
de
madame
maloir
quil
ne
servit
pas
une
fois
il
était
occupé
uniquement
de
nana
lair
vexé
de
la
voir
avec
fontan
dailleurs
les
tourtereaux
finissaient
par
être
ennuyeux
tant
ils
sembrassaient
contre
toutes
les
règles
ils
avaient
voulu
se
placer
lun
près
de
lautre
que
diable
mangez
vous
avez
bien
le
temps
répétait
bosc
la
bouche
pleine
attendez
que
nous
ne
soyons
plus
là
mais
nana
ne
pouvait
se
tenir
elle
était
dans
un
ravissement
damour
toute
rose
comme
une
vierge
avec
des
rires
et
des
regards
trempés
de
tendresse
les
yeux
fixés
sur
fontan
elle
laccablait
de
petits
noms
mon
chien
mon
loup
mon
chat
et
lorsquil
lui
passait
de
leau
ou
du
sel
elle
se
penchait
le
baisait
au
hasard
des
lèvres
sur
les
yeux
sur
le
nez
sur
une
oreille
puis
si
la
grondait
cétait
avec
des
tactiques
savantes
des
humilités
et
des
souplesses
de
chatte
battue
quelle
revenait
en
lui
prenant
sournoisement
la
main
pour
la
garder
et
la
baiser
encore
il
fallait
quelle
touchât
quelque
chose
de
lui
fontan
faisait
le
gros
dos
et
se
laissait
adorer
plein
de
condescendance
son
grand
nez
remuait
dune
joie
toute
sensuelle
son
museau
de
bouc
sa
laideur
de
monstre
cocasse
sétalait
dans
ladoration
dévote
de
cette
fille
superbe
si
blanche
et
si
grasse
par
moments
il
rendait
un
baiser
en
homme
qui
tout
le
plaisir
mais
qui
veut
se
montrer
gentil
la
fin
vous
êtes
agaçants
cria
prullière
vaten
de
là
toi
et
il
renvoya
fontan
il
changea
le
couvert
pour
prendre
sa
place
à
côté
de
nana
ce
furent
des
exclamations
des
applaudissements
des
mots
très
raides
fontan
mimait
le
désespoir
avec
ses
airs
drôles
de
vulcain
pleurant
vénus
tout
de
suite
prullière
se
montra
galant
mais
nana
dont
il
cherchait
le
pied
sous
la
table
lui
allongea
un
coup
pour
le
faire
tenir
tranquille
non
certes
elle
ne
coucherait
pas
avec
lui
lautre
mois
elle
avait
eu
un
commencement
de
béguin
à
cause
de
sa
jolie
tête
maintenant
elle
le
détestait
sil
la
pinçait
encore
en
feignant
de
ramasser
sa
serviette
elle
lui
jetterait
son
verre
par
la
figure
cependant
la
soirée
se
passa
bien
en
était
venu
naturellement
à
causer
des
variétés
cette
canaille
de
bordenave
ne
crèverait
donc
pas
ses
sales
maladies
reparaissaient
et
le
faisaient
tellement
souffrir
quil
nétait
plus
bon
à
prendre
avec
des
pincettes
la
veille
pendant
la
répétition
il
avait
gueulé
tout
le
temps
contre
simonne
en
voilà
un
que
les
artistes
ne
pleureraient
guère
nana
dit
que
sil
la
demandait
pour
un
rôle
elle
lenverrait
joliment
promener
dailleurs
elle
parlait
de
ne
plus
jouer
le
théâtre
ne
valait
pas
son
chezsoi
fontan
qui
nétait
pas
de
la
nouvelle
pièce
ni
de
celle
quon
répétait
exagérait
aussi
le
bonheur
davoir
sa
liberté
entière
de
passer
les
soirées
avec
sa
petite
chatte
les
pieds
devant
le
feu
et
les
autres
sexclamaient
les
traitant
de
veinards
affectant
denvier
leur
bonheur
avait
tiré
le
gâteau
des
rois
la
fève
était
tombée
à
madame
lerat
qui
la
mit
dans
le
verre
de
bosc
alors
ce
furent
des
cris
le
roi
boit
le
roi
boit
nana
profita
de
cet
éclat
de
gaieté
pour
aller
reprendre
fontan
par
le
cou
en
le
baisant
en
lui
disant
des
choses
dans
loreille
mais
prullière
avec
son
rire
vexé
de
joli
garçon
criait
que
ce
nétait
pas
de
jeu
louiset
dormait
sur
deux
chaises
enfin
la
société
ne
se
sépara
que
vers
une
heure
se
criait
au
revoir
à
travers
lescalier
et
pendant
trois
semaines
la
vie
des
deux
amoureux
fut
réellement
gentille
nana
croyait
retourner
à
ses
débuts
quand
sa
première
robe
de
soie
lui
avait
causé
un
si
gros
plaisir
elle
sortait
peu
jouant
à
la
solitude
et
à
la
simplicité
un
matin
de
bonne
heure
comme
elle
descendait
acheter
ellemême
du
poisson
au
marché
la
rochefoucauld
elle
resta
toute
saisie
de
se
rencontrer
nez
à
nez
avec
francis
son
ancien
coiffeur
il
avait
sa
correction
habituelle
linge
fin
redingote
irréprochable
et
elle
se
trouva
honteuse
dêtre
vue
par
lui
dans
la
rue
en
peignoir
ébouriffée
traînant
des
savates
mais
il
eut
le
tact
dexagérer
encore
sa
politesse
il
ne
se
permit
aucune
question
il
affectait
de
croire
que
madame
était
en
voyage
ah
madame
avait
fait
bien
des
malheureux
en
se
décidant
à
voyager
cétait
une
perte
pour
tout
le
monde
la
jeune
femme
cependant
finit
par
linterroger
prise
dune
curiosité
qui
lui
faisait
oublier
son
premier
embarras
comme
la
foule
les
bousculait
elle
le
poussa
sous
une
porte
où
elle
se
tint
debout
devant
lui
son
petit
panier
à
la
main
que
disaiton
de
sa
fugue
mon
dieu
les
dames
où
il
allait
disaient
ceci
disaient
cela
en
somme
un
bruit
énorme
un
vrai
succès
et
steiner
monsieur
steiner
était
bien
bas
ça
finirait
par
du
vilain
sil
ne
trouvait
pas
quelque
nouvelle
opération
et
daguenet
oh
celuilà
allait
parfaitement
monsieur
daguenet
arrangeait
sa
vie
nana
que
ses
souvenirs
excitaient
ouvrait
la
bouche
pour
le
questionner
encore
mais
elle
éprouva
une
gêne
à
prononcer
le
nom
de
muffat
alors
francis
souriant
parla
le
premier
quant
à
monsieur
le
comte
cétait
une
pitié
tant
il
avait
souffert
après
le
départ
de
madame
il
semblait
une
âme
en
peine
le
voyait
partout
où
madame
aurait
pu
être
enfin
monsieur
mignon
layant
rencontré
lavait
emmené
chez
lui
cette
nouvelle
fit
beaucoup
rire
nana
mais
dun
rire
contraint
ah
il
est
avec
rose
maintenant
ditelle
eh
bien
vous
savez
francis
je
men
fiche
voyezvous
ce
cafard
ça
vous
pris
des
habitudes
ça
ne
peut
pas
jeûner
seulement
huit
jours
et
lui
qui
jurait
de
ne
plus
avoir
de
femme
après
moi
au
fond
elle
enrageait
cest
mon
reste
repritelle
un
joli
coco
que
rose
sest
payé
là
oh
je
comprends
elle
voulu
se
venger
de
ce
que
je
lui
ai
pris
cette
brute
de
steiner
comme
cest
malin
dattirer
chez
soi
un
homme
que
jai
flanqué
dehors
monsieur
mignon
ne
raconte
pas
les
choses
de
la
sorte
dit
le
coiffeur
daprès
lui
cest
monsieur
le
comte
qui
vous
aurait
chassée
oui
et
dune
façon
dégoûtante
encore
avec
son
pied
au
derrière
du
coup
nana
devint
toute
pâle
hein
quoi
criatelle
son
pied
au
derrière
elle
est
trop
forte
cellelà
mais
mon
petit
cest
moi
qui
lai
jeté
en
bas
de
lescalier
ce
cocu
car
il
est
cocu
tu
dois
savoir
ça
sa
comtesse
le
fait
cocu
avec
tout
le
monde
même
avec
cette
fripouille
de
fauchery
et
ce
mignon
qui
bat
les
trottoirs
pour
sa
guenon
de
femme
dont
personne
ne
veut
tant
elle
est
maigre
quel
sale
monde
quel
sale
monde
elle
étranglait
elle
reprit
haleine
ah
ils
disent
ça
eh
bien
mon
petit
francis
je
vais
aller
les
trouver
moi
veuxtu
que
nous
allions
tout
de
suite
ensemble
oui
jirai
et
nous
verrons
sils
auront
le
toupet
de
parler
encore
de
coups
de
pied
au
derrière
des
coups
mais
je
nen
ai
jamais
toléré
de
personne
et
jamais
ne
battra
voistu
parce
que
je
mangerais
lhomme
qui
toucherait
pourtant
elle
sapaisa
après
tout
ils
pouvaient
bien
dire
ce
quils
voulaient
elle
ne
les
considérait
pas
plus
que
la
boue
de
ses
souliers
ça
laurait
salie
de
soccuper
de
ces
genslà
elle
avait
sa
conscience
pour
elle
et
francis
devenu
familier
la
voyant
se
livrer
ainsi
dans
son
peignoir
de
ménagère
se
permit
en
la
quittant
de
lui
donner
des
conseils
elle
avait
tort
de
tout
sacrifier
à
une
toquade
les
toquades
gâtaient
lexistence
elle
lécoutait
la
tête
basse
pendant
quil
parlait
dun
air
peiné
en
connaisseur
qui
souffrait
de
voir
une
si
belle
fille
se
gâcher
de
la
sorte
ça
cest
mon
affaire
finitelle
par
dire
merci
tout
de
même
mon
cher
elle
lui
serra
la
main
quil
avait
toujours
un
peu
grasse
malgré
sa
tenue
parfaite
puis
elle
descendit
acheter
son
poisson
dans
la
journée
cette
histoire
de
coup
de
pied
au
derrière
loccupa
elle
en
parla
même
à
fontan
elle
se
posa
de
nouveau
comme
une
femme
forte
qui
ne
supporterait
pas
une
chiquenaude
fontan
en
esprit
supérieur
déclara
que
tous
les
hommes
comme
il
faut
étaient
des
mufes
et
quon
devait
les
mépriser
nana
dès
lors
fut
pleine
dun
réel
dédain
justement
ce
soirlà
ils
allèrent
aux
bouffes
voir
débuter
dans
un
rôle
de
dix
lignes
une
petite
femme
que
fontan
connaissait
il
était
près
dune
heure
quand
ils
regagnèrent
à
pied
les
hauteurs
de
montmartre
rue
de
la
chausséedantin
ils
avaient
acheté
un
gâteau
un
moka
et
ils
le
mangèrent
dans
le
lit
parce
quil
ne
faisait
pas
chaud
et
que
ça
ne
valait
pas
la
peine
dallumer
du
feu
assis
sur
leur
séant
côte
à
côte
la
couverture
au
ventre
les
oreillers
tassés
derrière
le
dos
ils
soupaient
en
causant
de
la
petite
femme
nana
la
trouvait
laide
et
sans
chic
fontan
couché
sur
le
devant
passait
les
parts
de
gâteau
posées
au
bord
de
la
table
de
nuit
entre
la
bougie
et
les
allumettes
mais
ils
finirent
par
se
quereller
oh
si
peut
dire
criait
nana
elle
des
yeux
comme
des
trous
de
vrille
et
des
cheveux
couleur
filasse
taistoi
donc
répétait
fontan
une
chevelure
superbe
des
regards
pleins
de
feu
estce
drôle
que
vous
vous
mangiez
toujours
entre
femmes
il
avait
lair
vexé
allons
en
voilà
de
trop
ditil
enfin
dune
voix
brutale
tu
sais
je
naime
pas
quon
membête
dormons
ou
ça
va
mal
tourner
et
il
souffla
la
bougie
nana
furieuse
continuait
elle
ne
voulait
pas
quon
lui
parlât
sur
ce
ton
elle
avait
lhabitude
dêtre
respectée
comme
il
ne
répondait
plus
elle
dut
se
taire
mais
elle
ne
pouvait
sendormir
elle
se
tournait
se
retournait
nom
de
dieu
astu
fini
de
remuer
criatil
tout
dun
coup
avec
un
brusque
saut
ce
nest
pas
faute
sil
des
miettes
ditelle
sèchement
en
effet
il
avait
des
miettes
elle
en
sentait
jusque
sous
ses
cuisses
elle
était
dévorée
partout
une
seule
miette
la
brûlait
la
faisait
se
gratter
au
sang
dailleurs
lorsquon
mange
un
gâteau
estce
quon
ne
secoue
pas
toujours
la
couverture
fontan
dans
une
rage
froide
avait
rallumé
la
bougie
tous
deux
se
levèrent
et
pieds
nus
en
chemise
découvrant
le
lit
ils
balayèrent
les
miettes
sur
le
drap
avec
les
mains
lui
qui
grelottait
se
recoucha
en
lenvoyant
au
diable
parce
quelle
lui
recommandait
de
bien
sessuyer
les
pieds
enfin
elle
reprit
sa
place
mais
à
peine
allongée
elle
dansa
il
en
avait
encore
parbleu
cétait
sûr
répétaitelle
tu
les
remontées
avec
tes
pieds
je
ne
peux
pas
moi
je
te
dis
que
je
ne
peux
pas
et
elle
faisait
mine
de
lenjamber
pour
sauter
par
terre
alors
poussé
à
bout
voulant
dormir
fontan
lui
allongea
une
gifle
à
toute
volée
la
gifle
fut
si
forte
que
du
coup
nana
se
retrouva
couchée
la
tête
sur
loreiller
elle
resta
étourdie
oh
ditelle
simplement
avec
un
gros
soupir
denfant
un
instant
il
la
menaça
dune
autre
claque
en
lui
demandant
si
elle
bougerait
encore
puis
ayant
soufflé
la
lumière
il
sinstalla
carrément
sur
le
dos
il
ronfla
tout
de
suite
elle
le
nez
dans
loreiller
pleurait
à
petits
sanglots
cétait
lâche
dabuser
de
sa
force
mais
elle
avait
eu
une
vraie
peur
tant
le
masque
drôle
de
fontan
était
devenu
terrible
et
sa
colère
sen
allait
comme
si
la
gifle
lavait
calmée
elle
le
respectait
elle
se
collait
contre
le
mur
de
la
ruelle
pour
lui
laisser
toute
la
place
même
elle
finit
par
sendormir
la
joue
chaude
les
yeux
pleins
de
larmes
dans
un
accablement
délicieux
dans
une
soumission
si
lasse
quelle
ne
sentait
plus
les
miettes
le
matin
quand
elle
se
réveilla
elle
tenait
fontan
entre
ses
bras
nus
serré
contre
sa
gorge
bien
fort
nestce
pas
il
ne
recommencerait
jamais
jamais
plus
elle
laimait
trop
de
lui
cétait
encore
bon
dêtre
giflée
alors
ce
fut
une
vie
nouvelle
pour
un
oui
pour
un
non
fontan
lui
lâchait
des
claques
elle
accoutumée
empochait
ça
parfois
elle
criait
le
menaçait
mais
il
lacculait
contre
le
mur
en
parlant
de
létrangler
ce
qui
la
rendait
souple
le
plus
souvent
tombée
sur
une
chaise
elle
sanglotait
cinq
minutes
puis
elle
oubliait
très
gaie
avec
des
chants
et
des
rires
des
courses
qui
emplissaient
le
logement
du
vol
de
ses
jupes
le
pis
était
que
maintenant
fontan
disparaissait
toute
la
journée
et
ne
rentrait
jamais
avant
minuit
il
allait
dans
des
cafés
où
il
retrouvait
des
camarades
nana
tolérait
tout
tremblante
caressante
avec
la
seule
peur
de
ne
plus
le
voir
revenir
si
elle
lui
adressait
un
reproche
mais
certains
jours
quand
elle
navait
ni
madame
maloir
ni
sa
tante
avec
louiset
elle
sennuyait
mortellement
aussi
un
dimanche
comme
elle
était
au
marché
la
rochefoucauld
en
train
de
marchander
des
pigeons
futelle
enchantée
de
rencontrer
satin
qui
achetait
une
botte
de
radis
depuis
la
soirée
où
le
prince
avait
bu
le
champagne
de
fontan
elles
sétaient
perdues
de
vue
toutes
deux
comment
cest
toi
tu
es
du
quartier
dit
satin
stupéfaite
de
la
voir
en
pantoufles
dans
la
rue
à
cette
heure
ah
pauvre
fille
il
donc
de
la
panne
nana
la
fit
taire
dun
froncement
de
sourcil
parce
que
dautres
femmes
étaient
là
en
robe
de
chambre
sans
linge
les
cheveux
tombés
et
blancs
de
peluches
le
matin
toutes
les
filles
du
quartier
à
peine
lhomme
de
la
veille
mis
à
la
porte
venaient
faire
leurs
provisions
les
yeux
gros
de
sommeil
traînant
des
savates
dans
la
mauvaise
humeur
et
la
fatigue
dune
nuit
dembêtements
de
chaque
rue
du
carrefour
il
en
descendait
vers
le
marché
de
très
pâles
jeunes
encore
charmantes
dabandon
daffreuses
vieilles
et
ballonnées
lâchant
leur
peau
se
fichant
dêtre
vues
ainsi
en
dehors
des
heures
de
travail
pendant
que
sur
les
trottoirs
les
passants
se
retournaient
sans
quune
seule
daignât
sourire
toutes
affairées
avec
des
airs
dédaigneux
de
ménagères
pour
qui
les
hommes
nexistaient
plus
justement
comme
satin
payait
sa
botte
de
radis
un
jeune
homme
quelque
employé
attardé
lui
jeta
un
bonjour
chérie
au
passage
du
coup
elle
se
redressa
elle
eut
une
dignité
de
reine
offensée
en
disant
questce
qui
lui
prend
à
ce
cochonlà
puis
elle
crut
le
reconnaître
trois
jours
auparavant
vers
minuit
remontant
seule
du
boulevard
elle
lui
avait
parlé
près
dune
demiheure
au
coin
de
la
rue
la
bruyère
pour
le
décider
mais
cela
ne
fit
que
la
révolter
davantage
sontils
assez
mufes
de
vous
crier
des
choses
en
plein
jour
repritelle
quand
va
à
ses
affaires
nestce
pas
cest
pour
quon
vous
respecte
nana
avait
fini
par
acheter
ses
pigeons
bien
quelle
doutât
de
leur
fraîcheur
alors
satin
voulut
lui
montrer
sa
porte
elle
demeurait
à
côté
rue
la
rochefoucauld
et
dès
quelles
furent
seules
nana
conta
sa
passion
pour
fontan
arrivée
devant
chez
elle
la
petite
sétait
plantée
ses
radis
sous
le
bras
allumée
par
un
dernier
détail
que
lautre
donnait
mentant
à
son
tour
jurant
que
cétait
elle
qui
avait
flanqué
le
comte
muffat
dehors
à
grands
coups
de
pied
dans
le
derrière
oh
très
chic
répétait
satin
très
chic
des
coups
de
pied
et
il
n
rien
dit
nestce
pas
cest
si
lâche
jaurais
voulu
être
là
pour
voir
sa
gueule
chère
tu
raison
et
zut
pour
la
monnaie
moi
quand
jai
un
béguin
je
men
fais
crever
hein
viens
voir
tu
le
promets
la
porte
à
gauche
frappe
trois
coups
parce
quil
un
tas
demmerdeurs
dès
lors
quand
nana
sennuya
trop
elle
descendit
voir
satin
elle
était
toujours
certaine
de
la
trouver
celleci
ne
sortant
jamais
avant
six
heures
satin
occupait
deux
chambres
quun
pharmacien
lui
avait
meublées
pour
la
sauver
de
la
police
mais
en
moins
de
treize
mois
elle
avait
cassé
les
meubles
défoncé
les
sièges
sali
les
rideaux
dans
une
telle
rage
dordures
et
de
désordre
que
le
logement
semblait
habité
par
une
bande
de
chattes
en
folie
les
matins
où
dégoûtée
ellemême
elle
savisait
de
vouloir
nettoyer
il
lui
restait
aux
mains
des
barreaux
de
chaise
et
des
lambeaux
de
tenture
à
force
de
se
battre
làdedans
avec
la
crasse
ces
jourslà
cétait
plus
sale
ne
pouvait
plus
entrer
parce
quil
avait
des
choses
tombées
en
travers
des
portes
aussi
finissaitelle
par
abandonner
son
ménage
la
lampe
larmoire
à
glace
la
pendule
et
ce
qui
restait
des
rideaux
faisaient
encore
illusion
aux
hommes
dailleurs
depuis
six
mois
son
propriétaire
menaçait
de
lexpulser
alors
pour
qui
auraitelle
entretenu
ses
meubles
pour
lui
peutêtre
plus
souvent
et
quand
elle
se
levait
de
belle
humeur
elle
criait
hue
donc
en
allongeant
de
grands
coups
de
pied
dans
les
flancs
de
larmoire
et
de
la
commode
qui
craquaient
nana
presque
toujours
la
trouvait
couchée
même
les
jours
où
satin
descendait
pour
ses
commissions
elle
était
si
lasse
en
remontant
quelle
se
rendormait
jetée
au
bord
du
lit
dans
la
journée
elle
se
traînait
elle
sommeillait
sur
les
chaises
ne
sortant
de
cette
langueur
que
vers
le
soir
à
lheure
du
gaz
et
nana
se
sentait
très
bien
chez
elle
assise
à
ne
rien
faire
au
milieu
du
lit
défait
des
cuvettes
qui
traînaient
par
terre
des
jupons
crottés
de
la
veille
tachant
de
boue
les
fauteuils
cétaient
des
bavardages
des
confidences
sans
fin
pendant
que
satin
en
chemise
vautrée
et
les
pieds
plus
hauts
que
la
tête
lécoutait
en
fumant
des
cigarettes
parfois
elles
se
payaient
de
labsinthe
les
aprèsmidi
où
elles
avaient
des
chagrins
pour
oublier
disaientelles
sans
descendre
sans
même
passer
un
jupon
satin
allait
se
pencher
audessus
de
la
rampe
et
criait
la
commande
à
la
petite
de
la
concierge
une
gamine
de
dix
ans
qui
en
apportant
labsinthe
dans
un
verre
coulait
des
regards
sur
les
jambes
nues
de
la
dame
toutes
les
conversations
aboutissaient
à
la
saleté
des
hommes
nana
était
assommante
avec
son
fontan
elle
ne
pouvait
placer
dix
paroles
sans
retomber
dans
des
rabâchages
sur
ce
quil
disait
sur
ce
quil
faisait
mais
satin
bonne
fille
écoutait
sans
ennui
ces
éternelles
histoires
dattentes
à
la
fenêtre
de
querelles
pour
un
ragoût
brûlé
de
raccommodements
au
lit
après
des
heures
de
bouderie
muette
par
un
besoin
de
parler
de
ça
nana
en
était
arrivée
à
lui
conter
toutes
les
claques
quelle
recevait
la
semaine
passée
il
lui
avait
fait
enfler
loeil
la
veille
encore
à
propos
de
ses
pantoufles
quil
ne
trouvait
pas
il
lavait
jetée
dune
calotte
dans
la
table
de
nuit
et
lautre
ne
sétonnait
point
soufflant
la
fumée
de
sa
cigarette
sinterrompant
seulement
pour
dire
que
elle
toujours
se
baissait
ce
qui
envoyait
promener
le
monsieur
avec
sa
gifle
toutes
deux
se
tassaient
dans
ces
histoires
de
coups
heureuses
étourdies
des
mêmes
faits
imbéciles
cent
fois
répétés
cédant
à
la
molle
et
chaude
lassitude
des
roulées
indignes
dont
elles
parlaient
cétait
cette
joie
de
remâcher
les
claques
de
fontan
dexpliquer
fontan
jusque
dans
sa
façon
dôter
ses
bottes
qui
ramenait
chaque
jour
nana
dautant
plus
que
satin
finissait
par
sympathiser
elle
citait
des
faits
plus
forts
un
pâtissier
qui
la
laissait
par
terre
morte
et
quelle
aimait
quand
même
puis
venaient
les
jours
où
nana
pleurait
en
déclarant
que
ça
ne
pouvait
pas
continuer
satin
laccompagnait
jusqu
à
sa
porte
restait
une
heure
dans
la
rue
pour
voir
sil
ne
lassassinait
pas
et
le
lendemain
les
deux
femmes
jouissaient
toute
laprèsmidi
de
la
réconciliation
préférant
pourtant
sans
le
dire
les
jours
où
il
avait
des
raclées
dans
lair
parce
que
ça
les
passionnait
davantage
elles
devinrent
inséparables
pourtant
satin
nallait
jamais
chez
nana
fontan
ayant
déclaré
quil
ne
voulait
pas
de
traînée
dans
la
maison
elles
sortaient
ensemble
et
cest
ainsi
que
satin
mena
un
jour
son
amie
chez
une
femme
justement
cette
madame
robert
qui
préoccupait
nana
et
lui
causait
un
certain
respect
depuis
quelle
avait
refusé
de
venir
à
son
souper
madame
robert
demeurait
rue
mosnier
une
rue
neuve
et
silencieuse
du
quartier
de
leurope
sans
une
boutique
dont
les
belles
maisons
aux
petits
appartements
étroits
sont
peuplées
de
dames
il
était
cinq
heures
le
long
des
trottoirs
déserts
dans
la
paix
aristocratique
des
hautes
maisons
blanches
des
coupés
de
boursiers
et
de
négociants
stationnaient
tandis
que
des
hommes
filaient
vite
levant
les
yeux
vers
les
fenêtres
où
des
femmes
en
peignoir
semblaient
attendre
nana
dabord
refusa
de
monter
disant
dun
air
pincé
quelle
ne
connaissait
pas
cette
dame
mais
satin
insistait
pouvait
toujours
bien
mener
une
amie
avec
soi
elle
voulait
simplement
faire
une
visite
de
politesse
madame
robert
quelle
avait
rencontrée
la
veille
dans
un
restaurant
sétait
montrée
très
gentille
en
lui
faisant
jurer
de
la
venir
voir
et
nana
finit
par
céder
en
haut
une
petite
bonne
endormie
leur
dit
que
madame
nétait
pas
rentrée
pourtant
elle
voulut
bien
les
introduire
dans
le
salon
où
elle
les
laissa
bigre
cest
chic
murmura
satin
cétait
un
appartement
sévère
et
bourgeois
tendu
détoffes
sombres
avec
le
comme
il
faut
dun
boutiquier
parisien
retiré
après
fortune
faite
nana
impressionnée
voulut
plaisanter
mais
satin
se
fâchait
répondait
de
la
vertu
de
madame
robert
la
rencontrait
toujours
en
compagnie
dhommes
âgés
et
sérieux
qui
lui
donnaient
le
bras
pour
le
moment
elle
avait
un
ancien
chocolatier
esprit
grave
quand
il
venait
charmé
de
la
bonne
tenue
de
la
maison
il
se
faisait
annoncer
et
lappelait
mon
enfant
mais
tiens
la
voilà
reprit
satin
en
montrant
une
photographie
posée
devant
la
pendule
nana
étudia
le
portrait
un
instant
il
représentait
une
femme
très
brune
au
visage
allongé
les
lèvres
pincées
dans
un
sourire
discret
aurait
dit
tout
à
fait
une
dame
du
monde
avec
plus
de
retenue
cest
drôle
murmuratelle
enfin
jai
certainement
vu
cette
têtelà
quelque
part
où
je
ne
sais
plus
mais
ça
ne
devait
pas
être
dans
un
endroit
propre
oh
non
bien
sûr
ce
nétait
pas
un
endroit
propre
et
elle
ajouta
en
se
tournant
vers
son
amie
alors
elle
fait
promettre
de
venir
la
voir
que
te
veutelle
ce
quelle
veut
pardi
causer
sans
doute
rester
un
moment
ensemble
cest
de
la
politesse
nana
regardait
satin
fixement
puis
elle
eut
un
léger
claquement
de
langue
enfin
ça
lui
était
égal
mais
comme
cette
dame
les
faisait
poser
elle
déclara
quelle
nattendrait
pas
davantage
et
toutes
deux
partirent
le
lendemain
fontan
ayant
averti
nana
quil
ne
rentrerait
pas
dîner
elle
descendit
de
bonne
heure
chercher
satin
pour
lui
payer
un
régal
dans
un
restaurant
le
choix
du
restaurant
fut
une
grosse
question
satin
proposait
des
brasseries
que
nana
trouvait
infectes
enfin
elle
la
décida
à
manger
chez
laure
cétait
une
table
dhôte
rue
des
martyrs
où
le
dîner
coûtait
trois
francs
ennuyées
dattendre
lheure
ne
sachant
que
faire
sur
les
trottoirs
elles
montèrent
chez
laure
vingt
minutes
trop
tôt
les
trois
salons
étaient
encore
vides
elles
se
placèrent
à
une
table
dans
le
salon
même
où
laure
piedefer
trônait
sur
la
haute
banquette
dun
comptoir
cette
laure
était
une
dame
de
cinquante
ans
aux
formes
débordantes
sanglée
dans
des
ceintures
et
des
corsets
des
femmes
arrivaient
à
la
file
se
haussaient
pardessus
les
soucoupes
et
baisaient
laure
sur
la
bouche
avec
une
familiarité
tendre
pendant
que
ce
monstre
les
yeux
mouillés
tâchait
en
se
partageant
de
ne
pas
faire
de
jalouses
la
bonne
au
contraire
était
une
grande
maigre
ravagée
qui
servait
ces
dames
les
paupières
noires
les
regards
flambant
dun
feu
sombre
rapidement
les
trois
salons
semplirent
il
avait
là
une
centaine
de
clientes
mêlées
au
hasard
des
tables
la
plupart
touchant
à
la
quarantaine
énormes
avec
des
empâtements
de
chair
des
bouffissures
de
vice
noyant
les
bouches
molles
et
au
milieu
de
ces
ballonnements
de
gorges
et
de
ventres
apparaissaient
quelques
jolies
filles
minces
lair
encore
ingénu
sous
leffronterie
du
geste
des
débutantes
levées
dans
un
bastringue
et
amenées
par
une
cliente
chez
laure
où
le
peuple
des
grosses
femmes
mis
en
lair
à
lodeur
de
leur
jeunesse
se
bousculait
faisait
autour
delles
une
cour
de
vieux
garçons
inquiets
en
leur
payant
des
gourmandises
quant
aux
hommes
ils
étaient
peu
nombreux
dix
à
quinze
au
plus
lattitude
humble
sous
le
flot
envahissant
des
jupes
sauf
quatre
gaillards
qui
blaguaient
très
à
laise
venus
pour
voir
ça
nestce
pas
disait
satin
cest
très
bon
leur
fricot
nana
hochait
la
tête
satisfaite
cétait
lancien
dîner
solide
dun
hôtel
de
province
volauvent
à
la
financière
poule
au
riz
haricots
au
jus
crème
à
la
vanille
glacée
de
caramel
ces
dames
tombaient
particulièrement
sur
la
poule
au
riz
éclatant
dans
leurs
corsages
sessuyant
les
lèvres
dune
main
lente
dabord
nana
avait
eu
peur
de
rencontrer
danciennes
amies
qui
lui
auraient
fait
des
questions
bêtes
mais
elle
se
tranquillisa
elle
napercevait
aucune
figure
de
connaissance
parmi
cette
foule
très
mélangée
où
des
robes
déteintes
des
chapeaux
lamentables
sétalaient
à
côté
de
toilettes
riches
dans
la
fraternité
des
mêmes
perversions
un
instant
elle
fut
intéressée
par
un
jeune
homme
aux
cheveux
courts
et
bouclés
le
visage
insolent
tenant
sans
haleine
pendue
à
ses
moindres
caprices
toute
une
table
de
filles
qui
crevaient
de
graisse
mais
comme
le
jeune
homme
riait
sa
poitrine
se
gonfla
tiens
cest
une
femme
laissatelle
échapper
dans
un
léger
cri
satin
qui
se
bourrait
de
poule
leva
la
tête
en
murmurant
ah
oui
je
la
connais
très
chic
se
larrache
nana
fit
une
moue
dégoûtée
elle
ne
comprenait
pas
encore
ça
pourtant
elle
disait
de
sa
voix
raisonnable
que
des
goûts
et
des
couleurs
il
ne
fallait
pas
disputer
car
ne
savait
jamais
ce
quon
pourrait
aimer
un
jour
aussi
mangeaitelle
sa
crème
dun
air
de
philosophie
en
sapercevant
parfaitement
que
satin
révolutionnait
les
tables
voisines
avec
ses
grands
yeux
bleus
de
vierge
il
avait
surtout
près
delle
une
forte
personne
blonde
très
aimable
elle
flambait
elle
se
poussait
si
bien
que
nana
était
sur
le
point
dintervenir
mais
à
ce
moment
une
femme
qui
entrait
lui
causa
une
surprise
elle
avait
reconnu
madame
robert
celleci
avec
sa
jolie
mine
de
souris
brune
adressa
un
signe
de
tête
familier
à
la
grande
bonne
maigre
puis
vint
sappuyer
au
comptoir
de
laure
et
toutes
deux
se
baisèrent
longuement
nana
trouva
cette
caresselà
très
drôle
de
la
part
dune
femme
si
distinguée
dautant
plus
que
madame
robert
navait
pas
du
tout
son
air
modeste
au
contraire
elle
jetait
des
coups
doeil
dans
le
salon
causant
à
voix
basse
laure
venait
de
se
rasseoir
tassée
de
nouveau
avec
la
majesté
dune
vieille
idole
du
vice
à
la
face
usée
et
vernie
par
les
baisers
des
fidèles
et
audessus
des
assiettes
pleines
elle
régnait
sur
sa
clientèle
bouffie
de
grosses
femmes
monstrueuse
auprès
des
plus
fortes
trônant
dans
cette
fortune
de
maîtresse
dhôtel
qui
récompensait
quarante
années
dexercice
mais
madame
robert
avait
aperçu
satin
elle
lâcha
laure
accourut
se
montra
charmante
disant
combien
elle
regrettait
de
ne
sêtre
pas
trouvée
chez
elle
la
veille
et
comme
satin
séduite
voulait
absolument
lui
faire
une
petite
place
elle
jurait
quelle
avait
dîné
elle
était
montée
simplement
pour
voir
tout
en
parlant
debout
derrière
sa
nouvelle
amie
elle
sappuyait
à
ses
épaules
souriante
et
câline
répétant
voyons
quand
vous
verraije
si
vous
étiez
libre
nana
malheureusement
ne
put
en
entendre
davantage
cette
conversation
la
vexait
elle
brûlait
de
dire
ses
quatre
vérités
à
cette
femme
honnête
mais
la
vue
dune
bande
qui
arrivait
la
paralysa
cétaient
des
femmes
chic
en
grande
toilette
avec
leurs
diamants
elles
venaient
en
partie
chez
laure
quelles
tutoyaient
toutes
reprises
dun
goût
pervers
promenant
des
cent
mille
francs
de
pierreries
sur
leur
peau
pour
dîner
là
à
trois
francs
par
tête
dans
létonnement
jaloux
des
pauvres
filles
crottées
lorsquelles
étaient
entrées
la
voix
haute
le
rire
clair
apportant
du
dehors
comme
un
coup
de
soleil
nana
avait
vivement
tourné
la
tête
très
ennuyée
de
reconnaître
parmi
elles
lucy
stewart
et
maria
blond
pendant
près
de
cinq
minutes
tout
le
temps
que
ces
dames
causèrent
avec
laure
avant
de
passer
dans
le
salon
voisin
elle
tint
le
nez
baissé
ayant
lair
très
occupée
à
rouler
des
miettes
de
pain
sur
la
nappe
puis
quand
elle
put
enfin
se
retourner
elle
demeura
stupéfaite
la
chaise
près
delle
était
vide
satin
avait
disparu
eh
bien
où
estelle
donc
laissatelle
échapper
tout
haut
la
forte
personne
blonde
qui
avait
comblé
satin
dattentions
eut
un
rire
dans
sa
mauvaise
humeur
et
comme
nana
irritée
de
ce
rire
la
regardait
dun
oeil
menaçant
elle
dit
mollement
la
voix
traînante
ce
nest
pas
moi
bien
sûr
cest
lautre
qui
vous
l
faite
alors
nana
comprenant
quon
se
moquerait
delle
najouta
rien
elle
resta
même
un
moment
assise
ne
voulant
pas
montrer
sa
colère
au
fond
du
salon
voisin
elle
entendait
les
éclats
de
lucy
stewart
qui
régalait
toute
une
table
de
petites
filles
descendues
des
bals
de
montmartre
et
de
la
chapelle
il
faisait
très
chaud
la
bonne
enlevait
des
piles
dassiettes
sales
dans
lodeur
forte
de
la
poule
au
riz
tandis
que
les
quatre
messieurs
avaient
fini
par
verser
du
vin
fin
à
une
demidouzaine
de
ménages
rêvant
de
les
griser
pour
en
entendre
de
raides
maintenant
ce
qui
exaspérait
nana
cétait
de
payer
le
dîner
de
satin
en
voilà
une
garce
qui
se
laissait
goberger
et
qui
filait
avec
le
premier
chien
coiffé
sans
dire
merci
sans
doute
ce
nétait
que
trois
francs
mais
ça
lui
semblait
dur
tout
de
même
la
manière
était
trop
dégoûtante
elle
paya
pourtant
elle
jeta
ses
six
francs
à
laure
quelle
méprisait
à
cette
heure
plus
que
la
boue
des
ruisseaux
dans
la
rue
des
martyrs
nana
sentit
encore
grandir
sa
rancune
bien
sûr
elle
nallait
pas
courir
après
satin
une
jolie
ordure
pour
mettre
le
nez
mais
sa
soirée
se
trouvait
gâtée
et
elle
remonta
lentement
vers
montmartre
enragée
surtout
contre
madame
robert
cellelà
par
exemple
avait
un
fameux
toupet
de
faire
la
femme
distinguée
oui
distinguée
dans
le
coin
aux
épluchures
présent
elle
était
certaine
de
lavoir
rencontrée
au
papillon
un
infect
bastringue
de
la
rue
des
poissonniers
où
des
hommes
la
levaient
pour
trente
sous
et
ça
empaumait
des
chefs
de
bureau
par
des
airs
modestes
et
ça
refusait
des
soupers
auxquels
lui
faisait
lhonneur
de
linviter
histoire
de
se
poser
en
vertu
vrai
lui
en
flanquerait
de
la
vertu
cétait
toujours
ces
bégueuleslà
qui
sen
donnaient
à
crever
dans
des
trous
ignobles
que
personne
ne
connaissait
cependant
nana
en
roulant
ces
choses
était
arrivée
chez
elle
rue
véron
elle
fut
toute
secouée
de
voir
de
la
lumière
fontan
rentrait
maussade
lâché
lui
aussi
par
lami
qui
lui
avait
payé
à
dîner
il
écouta
dun
air
froid
les
explications
quelle
donnait
craignant
des
calottes
effarée
de
le
trouver
là
lorsquelle
ne
lattendait
pas
avant
une
heure
du
matin
elle
mentait
elle
avouait
bien
avoir
dépensé
six
francs
mais
avec
madame
maloir
alors
il
resta
digne
il
lui
tendit
une
lettre
à
son
adresse
quil
avait
tranquillement
décachetée
cétait
une
lettre
de
georges
toujours
enfermé
aux
fondettes
se
soulageant
chaque
semaine
dans
des
pages
brûlantes
nana
adorait
quon
lui
écrivît
surtout
de
grandes
phrases
damour
avec
des
serments
elle
lisait
ça
à
tout
le
monde
fontan
connaissait
le
style
de
georges
et
lappréciait
mais
ce
soirlà
elle
redoutait
tellement
une
scène
quelle
affecta
lindifférence
elle
parcourut
la
lettre
dun
air
maussade
et
la
rejeta
aussitôt
fontan
sétait
mis
à
battre
la
retraite
sur
une
vitre
ennuyé
de
se
coucher
de
si
bonne
heure
ne
sachant
plus
à
quoi
occuper
sa
soirée
brusquement
il
se
tourna
si
lon
répondait
tout
de
suite
à
ce
gamin
ditil
dhabitude
cétait
lui
qui
écrivait
il
luttait
de
style
puis
il
était
heureux
lorsque
nana
enthousiasmée
de
la
lecture
de
sa
lettre
faite
tout
haut
lembrassait
en
criant
quil
n
avait
que
lui
pour
trouver
des
choses
pareilles
ça
finissait
par
les
allumer
et
ils
sadoraient
comme
tu
voudras
réponditelle
je
vais
faire
du
thé
nous
nous
coucherons
ensuite
alors
fontan
sinstalla
sur
la
table
avec
un
grand
déploiement
de
plume
dencre
et
de
papier
il
arrondissait
les
bras
allongeait
le
menton
mon
coeur
commençatil
à
voix
haute
et
pendant
plus
dune
heure
il
sappliqua
réfléchissant
parfois
sur
une
phrase
la
tête
entre
les
mains
raffinant
se
riant
à
luimême
quand
il
avait
trouvé
une
expression
tendre
nana
silencieusement
avait
déjà
pris
deux
tasses
de
thé
enfin
il
lut
la
lettre
comme
lit
au
théâtre
avec
une
voix
blanche
en
indiquant
quelques
gestes
il
parlait
làdedans
en
cinq
pages
des
heures
délicieuses
passées
à
la
mignotte
ces
heures
dont
le
souvenir
restait
comme
des
parfums
subtils
il
jurait
une
éternelle
fidélité
à
ce
printemps
de
lamour
et
finissait
en
déclarant
que
son
unique
désir
était
de
recommencer
ce
bonheur
si
le
bonheur
peut
se
recommencer
tu
sais
expliquatil
je
dis
tout
ça
par
politesse
du
moment
que
cest
pour
rire
hein
je
crois
quelle
est
touchée
cellelà
il
triomphait
mais
nana
maladroite
se
méfiant
toujours
commit
la
faute
de
ne
pas
lui
sauter
au
cou
en
sexclamant
elle
trouva
la
lettre
bien
pas
davantage
alors
il
fut
très
vexé
si
sa
lettre
ne
lui
plaisait
pas
elle
pouvait
en
faire
une
autre
et
au
lieu
de
se
baiser
comme
dhabitude
après
avoir
remué
des
phrases
damour
ils
restèrent
froids
aux
deux
côtés
de
la
table
pourtant
elle
lui
avait
versé
une
tasse
de
thé
en
voilà
une
cochonnerie
criatil
en
trempant
les
lèvres
tu
donc
mis
du
sel
nana
eut
le
malheur
de
hausser
les
épaules
il
devint
furieux
ah
ça
tourne
mal
ce
soir
et
la
querelle
partit
de
là
la
pendule
ne
marquait
que
dix
heures
cétait
une
façon
de
tuer
le
temps
il
se
fouettait
il
lançait
au
visage
de
nana
dans
un
flot
dinjures
toutes
sortes
daccusations
lune
sur
lautre
sans
lui
permettre
de
se
défendre
elle
était
sale
elle
était
bête
elle
avait
roulé
partout
puis
il
sacharna
sur
la
question
dargent
estce
quil
dépensait
six
francs
lui
quand
il
dînait
en
ville
lui
payait
à
dîner
sans
quoi
il
aurait
mangé
son
potaufeu
et
pour
cette
vieille
procureuse
de
maloir
encore
un
carcan
quil
flanquerait
à
la
porte
le
lendemain
ah
bien
ils
iraient
loin
si
chaque
jour
lui
et
elle
jetaient
comme
ça
des
six
francs
à
la
rue
dabord
je
veux
des
comptes
criatil
voyons
donne

où
en
sommesnous
tous
ses
instincts
davarice
sordide
éclataient
nana
dominée
effarée
se
hâta
de
prendre
dans
le
secrétaire
largent
qui
leur
restait
et
de
lapporter
devant
lui
jusquelà
la
clef
demeurait
sur
la
caisse
commune
ils
puisaient
librement
comment
ditil
après
avoir
compté
il
reste
à
peine
sept
mille
francs
sur
dixsept
mille
et
nous
ne
sommes
ensemble
que
depuis
trois
mois
ce
nest

le
secrétaire

le
tiroir
pour
le
fouiller
sous
la
lampe
mais
il
n
avait
bien
que
six
mille
huit
cents
et
quelques
francs
alors
ce
fut
une
tempête

mille
francs

trois
mois
gueulaitil

bien
facile
à

meubles
puis
jai
dû
acheter
du
linge
ça
va
vite
quand
sinstalle
mais
tout
en
exigeant
des
explications
il
ne
voulait
pas
les
entendre
oui
ça
va
trop
vite
repritil
plus
calme
et
voistu
petite
jen
ai
assez
de
cette
cuisine
en
commun
tu
sais
que
ces
sept
mille
francs
sont
à
moi
eh
bien
puisque
je
les
tiens
je
les
garde
dame
du
moment
que
tu
es
une
gâcheuse
je
nai
pas
envie
dêtre
ruiné
chacun
son
bien
et
magistralement
il
mit
largent
dans
sa
poche
nana
le
regardait
stupéfaite
lui
continuait
avec
complaisance
tu
comprends
je
ne
suis
pas
assez
bête
pour
entretenir
des
tantes
et
des
enfants
qui
ne
sont
pas
à
moi
ça
plu
de
dépenser
ton
argent
ça
te
regarde
mais
le
mien
cest
sacré
quand
tu
feras
cuire
un
gigot
jen
paierai
la
moitié
le
soir
nous
réglerons
voilà
du
coup
nana
fut
révoltée
elle
ne
put
retenir
ce
cri
dis
donc
tu
bien
mangé
mes
dix
mille
francs
cest
cochon
ça
mais
il
ne
sattarda
pas
à
discuter
davantage
pardessus
la
table
à
toute
volée
il
lui
allongea
un
soufflet
en
disant
répète
un
peu
elle
répéta
malgré
la
claque
et
il
tomba
sur
elle
à
coups
de
pied
et
à
coups
de
poing
bientôt
il
leut
mise
dans
un
tel
état
quelle
finit
comme
dhabitude
par
se
déshabiller
et
se
coucher
en
pleurant
lui
soufflait
il
se
couchait
à
son
tour
lorsquil
aperçut
sur
la
table
la
lettre
quil
avait
écrite
à
georges
alors
il
la
plia
avec
soin
tourné
vers
le
lit
en
disant
dun
air
menaçant
elle
est
très
bien
je
la
mettrai
à
la
poste
moimême
parce
que
je
naime
pas
les
caprices
et
ne
geins
plus
tu
magaces
nana
qui
pleurait
à
petits
soupirs
retint
son
souffle
quand
il
fut
couché
elle
étouffa
elle
se
jeta
sur
sa
poitrine
en
sanglotant
leurs
batteries
se
terminaient
toujours
par
là
elle
tremblait
de
le
perdre
elle
avait
un
lâche
besoin
de
le
savoir
à
elle
malgré
tout
deux
reprises
il
la
repoussa
dun
geste
superbe
mais
lembrassement
tiède
de
cette
femme
qui
le
suppliait
avec
ses
grands
yeux
mouillés
de
bête
fidèle
le
chauffa
dun
désir
et
il
se
fit
bon
prince
sans
pourtant
sabaisser
à
aucune
avance
il
se
laissa
caresser
et
prendre
de
force
en
homme
dont
le
pardon
vaut
la
peine
dêtre
gagné
puis
il
fut
saisi
dune
inquiétude
il
craignit
que
nana
ne
jouât
une
comédie
pour
ravoir
la
clef
de
la
caisse
la
bougie
était
éteinte
lorsquil
éprouva
le
besoin
de
maintenir
sa
volonté
tu
sais
fille
cest
très
sérieux
je
garde
largent
nana
qui
sendormait
à
son
cou
trouva
un
mot
sublime
oui
naie
pas
peur
je
travaillerai
mais
à
partir
de
cette
soirée
la
vie
entre
eux
devint
de
plus
en
plus
difficile
dun
bout
de
la
semaine
à
lautre
il
avait
un
bruit
de
gifles
un
vrai
tictac
dhorloge
qui
semblait
régler
leur
existence
nana
à
force
dêtre
battue
prenait
une
souplesse
de
linge
fin
et
ça
la
rendait
délicate
de
peau
rose
et
blanche
de
teint
si
douce
au
toucher
si
claire
à
loeil
quelle
avait
encore
embelli
aussi
prullière
senrageaitil
après
ses
jupes
venant
lorsque
fontan
nétait
pas
là
la
poussant
dans
les
coins
pour
lembrasser
mais
elle
se
débattait
indignée
tout
de
suite
avec
des
rougeurs
de
honte
elle
trouvait
dégoûtant
quil
voulût
tromper
un
ami
alors
prullière
ricanait
dun
air
vexé
vrai
elle
devenait
joliment
bête
comment
pouvaitelle
sattacher
à
un
pareil
singe
car
enfin
fontan
était
un
vrai
singe
avec
son
grand
nez
toujours
en
branle
une
sale
tête
et
un
homme
qui
lassommait
encore
possible
je
laime
comme
ça
réponditelle
un
jour
de
lair
tranquille
dune
femme
avouant
un
goût
abominable
bosc
se
contentait
de
dîner
le
plus
souvent
possible
il
haussait
les
épaules
derrière
prullière
un
joli
garçon
mais
un
garçon
pas
sérieux
lui
plusieurs
fois
avait
assisté
à
des
scènes
dans
le
ménage
au
dessert
lorsque
fontan
giflait
nana
il
continuait
à
mâcher
gravement
trouvant
ça
naturel
pour
payer
son
dîner
il
sextasiait
toujours
sur
leur
bonheur
il
se
proclamait
philosophe
il
avait
renoncé
à
tout
même
à
la
gloire
prullière
et
fontan
parfois
renversés
sur
leur
chaise
soubliaient
devant
la
table
desservie
se
racontaient
leurs
succès
jusqu
à
deux
heures
du
matin
avec
leurs
gestes
et
leur
voix
de
théâtre
tandis
que
lui
absorbé
ne
lâchant
de
loin
en
loin
quun
petit
souffle
de
dédain
achevait
silencieusement
la
bouteille
de
cognac
questce
quil
restait
de
talma
rien
alors
quon
lui
fichât
la
paix
cétait
trop
bête
un
soir
il
trouva
nana
en
larmes
elle
ôta
sa
camisole
pour
montrer
son
dos
et
ses
bras
noirs
de
coups
il
lui
regarda
la
peau
sans
être
tenté
dabuser
de
la
situation
comme
laurait
fait
cet
imbécile
de
prullière
puis
sentencieusement
fille
où
il
des
femmes
il
des
claques
cest
napoléon
qui
dit
ça
je
crois
lavetoi
avec
de
leau
salée
excellent
leau
salée
pour
ces
bobos
va
tu
en
recevras
dautres
et
ne
te
plains
pas
tant
que
tu
nauras
rien
de
cassé
tu
sais
je
minvite
jai
vu
un
gigot
mais
madame
lerat
navait
pas
cette
philosophie
chaque
fois
que
nana
lui
montrait
un
nouveau
bleu
sur
sa
peau
blanche
elle
poussait
les
hauts
cris
lui
tuait
sa
nièce
ça
ne
pouvait
pas
durer
la
vérité
fontan
avait
mis
à
la
porte
madame
lerat
en
disant
quil
ne
voulait
plus
la
rencontrer
chez
lui
et
depuis
ce
jour
quand
elle
était
là
et
quil
rentrait
elle
devait
sen
aller
par
la
cuisine
ce
qui
lhumiliait
horriblement
aussi
ne
tarissaitelle
pas
contre
ce
grossier
personnage
elle
lui
reprochait
surtout
dêtre
mal
élevé
avec
des
mines
de
femme
comme
il
faut
à
qui
personne
ne
pouvait
en
remontrer
sur
la
bonne
éducation
oh
ça
se
voit
tout
de
suite
disaitelle
à
nana
il
n
pas
le
sentiment
des
moindres
convenances
sa
mère
devait
être
commune
ne
dis
pas
non
ça
se
sent
je
ne
parle
pas
pour
moi
bien
quune
personne
de
mon
âge
ait
droit
aux
égards
mais
toi
vraiment
comment
faistu
pour
endurer
ses
mauvaises
manières
car
sans
flatter
je
tai
toujours
appris
à
te
tenir
et
tu
reçu
chez
toi
les
meilleurs
conseils
hein
nous
étions
tous
très
bien
dans
la
famille
nana
ne
protestait
pas
écoutait
la
tête
basse
puis
continuait
la
tante
tu
nas
connu
que
des
personnes
distinguées
justement
nous
causions
de
ça
hier
soir
avec
zoé
chez
moi
elle
non
plus
ne
comprend
pas
comment
disaitelle
madame
qui
menait
monsieur
le
comte
un
homme
si
parfait
au
doigt
et
à
loeil
car
entre
nous
il
paraît
que
tu
le
faisais
tourner
en
bourrique
comment
madame
peutelle
se
laisser
massacrer
par
ce
polichinelle
moi
jai
ajouté
que
les
coups
ça
se
supportait
encore
mais
que
jamais
je
naurais
souffert
le
manque
dégards
enfin
il
n
rien
pour
lui
je
ne
le
voudrais
pas
dans
chambre
en
peinture
et
tu
te
ruines
pour
un
oiseau
pareil
oui
tu
te
ruines
chérie
tu
tires
la
langue
lorsquil
en
tant
et
des
plus
riches
et
des
personnages
du
gouvernement
suffit
ce
nest
pas
moi
qui
dois
dire
ces
choses
mais
à
la
première
saleté
je
te
le
planterais
là
avec
un
monsieur
pour
qui
prenezvous
tu
sais
de
ton
grand
air
qui
lui
couperait
bras
et
jambes
alors
nana
éclatait
en
sanglots
balbutiant
oh
tante
je
laime
la
vérité
était
que
madame
lerat
se
sentait
inquiète
en
voyant
sa
nièce
lui
donner
à
grandpeine
des
pièces
de
vingt
sous
de
loin
en
loin
pour
payer
la
pension
du
petit
louis
sans
doute
elle
se
dévouerait
elle
garderait
quand
même
lenfant
et
attendrait
des
temps
meilleurs
mais
lidée
que
fontan
les
empêchait
elle
le
gamin
et
sa
mère
de
nager
dans
lor
lenrageait
au
point
de
lui
faire
nier
lamour
aussi
concluaitelle
par
ces
paroles
sévères
écoute
un
jour
quil
taura
enlevé
la
peau
du
ventre
tu
viendras
frapper
à
porte
et
je
touvrirai
bientôt
largent
devint
le
gros
souci
de
nana
fontan
avait
fait
disparaître
les
sept
mille
francs
sans
doute
ils
étaient
en
lieu
sûr
et
jamais
elle
naurait
osé
le
questionner
car
elle
montrait
des
pudeurs
avec
cet
oiseau
comme
lappelait
madame
lerat
elle
tremblait
quil
pût
la
croire
capable
de
tenir
à
lui
pour
ses
quatre
sous
il
avait
bien
promis
de
fournir
aux
besoins
du
ménage
les
premiers
jours
chaque
matin
il
donnait
trois
francs
mais
cétaient
des
exigences
dhomme
qui
paie
avec
ses
trois
francs
il
voulait
de
tout
du
beurre
de
la
viande
des
primeurs
et
si
elle
risquait
des
observations
si
elle
insinuait
quon
ne
pouvait
pas
avoir
les
halles
pour
trois
francs
il
semportait
il
la
traitait
de
bonne
à
rien
de
gâcheuse
de
fichue
bête
que
les
marchands
volaient
toujours
prêt
dailleurs
à
la
menacer
de
prendre
pension
autre
part
puis
au
bout
dun
mois
certains
matins
il
avait
oublié
de
mettre
les
trois
francs
sur
la
commode
elle
sétait
permis
de
les
demander
timidement
dune
façon
détournée
alors
il
avait
eu
de
telles
querelles
il
lui
rendait
la
vie
si
dure
sous
le
premier
prétexte
venu
quelle
préférait
ne
plus
compter
sur
lui
au
contraire
quand
il
navait
pas
laissé
les
trois
pièces
de
vingt
sous
et
quil
trouvait
tout
de
même
à
manger
il
était
gai
comme
un
pinson
galant
baisant
nana
valsant
avec
les
chaises
et
elle
tout
heureuse
en
arrivait
à
souhaiter
de
ne
rien
trouver
sur
la
commode
malgré
le
mal
quelle
avait
à
joindre
les
deux
bouts
un
jour
même
elle
lui
rendit
ses
trois
francs
contant
une
histoire
disant
avoir
encore
largent
de
la
veille
comme
il
navait
pas
donné
la
veille
il
demeura
un
instant
hésitant
par
crainte
dune
leçon
mais
elle
le
regardait
de
ses
yeux
damour
elle
le
baisait
dans
un
absolu
de
toute
sa
personne
et
il
rempocha
les
pièces
avec
le
petit
tremblement
convulsif
dun
avare
qui
rattrape
une
somme
compromise
partir
de
ce
jour
il
ne
sinquiéta
plus
ne
demandant
jamais
doù
venait
la
monnaie
la
mine
grise
quand
il
avait
des
pommes
de
terre
riant
à
se
décrocher
les
mâchoires
devant
les
dindes
et
les
gigots
sans
préjudice
pourtant
de
quelques
claques
quil
allongeait
à
nana
même
dans
son
bonheur
pour
sentretenir
la
main
nana
avait
donc
trouvé
le
moyen
de
suffire
à
tout
la
maison
certains
jours
regorgeait
de
nourriture
deux
fois
par
semaine
bosc
prenait
des
indigestions
un
soir
que
madame
lerat
se
retirait
enragée
de
voir
au
feu
un
dîner
copieux
dont
elle
ne
mangerait
pas
elle
ne
put
sempêcher
de
demander
brutalement
qui
estce
qui
payait
nana
surprise
devint
toute
bête
et
se
mit
à
pleurer
eh
bien
cest
du
propre
dit
la
tante
qui
avait
compris
nana
sétait
résignée
pour
avoir
la
paix
dans
son
ménage
puis
cétait
la
faute
de
la
tricon
quelle
avait
rencontrée
rue
de
laval
un
jour
que
fontan
était
parti
furieux
à
cause
dun
plat
de
morue
alors
elle
avait
dit
oui
à
la
tricon
qui
justement
se
trouvait
en
peine
comme
fontan
ne
rentrait
jamais
avant
six
heures
elle
disposait
de
son
aprèsmidi
elle
rapportait
quarante
francs
soixante
francs
quelquefois
davantage
elle
aurait
pu
parler
par
dix
et
quinze
louis
si
elle
avait
su
garder
sa
situation
mais
elle
était
encore
bien
contente
de
trouver
là
de
quoi
faire
bouillir
la
marmite
le
soir
elle
oubliait
tout
lorsque
bosc
crevait
de
nourriture
et
que
fontan
les
coudes
sur
la
table
se
laissait
baiser
les
yeux
de
lair
supérieur
dun
homme
qui
est
aimé
pour
luimême
alors
tout
en
adorant
son
chéri
son
chien
aimé
avec
une
passion
dautant
plus
aveugle
quelle
payait
à
cette
heure
nana
retomba
dans
la
crotte
du
début
elle
roula
elle
battit
le
pavé
de
ses
anciennes
savates
de
petit
torchon
en
quête
dune
pièce
de
cent
sous
un
dimanche
au
marché
la
rochefoucauld
elle
avait
fait
la
paix
avec
satin
après
sêtre
jetée
sur
elle
en
lui
reprochant
madame
robert
furieusement
mais
satin
se
contentait
de
répondre
que
lorsquon
naimait
pas
une
chose
ce
nétait
pas
une
raison
pour
vouloir
en
dégoûter
les
autres
et
nana
desprit
large
cédant
à
cette
idée
philosophique
quon
ne
sait
jamais
par
où
lon
finira
avait
pardonné
même
la
curiosité
mise
en
éveil
elle
la
questionnait
sur
des
coins
de
vice
stupéfiée
den
apprendre
encore
à
son
âge
après
tout
ce
quelle
savait
et
elle
riait
elle
sexclamait
trouvant
ça
drôle
un
peu
répugnée
cependant
car
au
fond
elle
était
bourgeoise
pour
ce
qui
nentrait
pas
dans
ses
habitudes
aussi
retournatelle
chez
laure
mangeant
là
lorsque
fontan
dînait
en
ville
elle
amusait
des
histoires
des
amours
et
des
jalousies
qui
passionnaient
les
clientes
sans
leur
faire
perdre
un
coup
de
fourchette
pourtant
elle
nen
était
toujours
pas
comme
elle
disait
la
grosse
laure
avec
sa
maternité
attendrie
linvitait
souvent
à
passer
quelques
jours
dans
sa
villa
dasnières
une
maison
de
campagne
où
il
avait
des
chambres
pour
sept
dames
elle
refusait
elle
avait
peur
mais
satin
lui
ayant
juré
quelle
se
trompait
que
des
messieurs
de
paris
vous
balançaient
et
jouaient
au
tonneau
elle
promit
pour
plus
tard
quand
elle
pourrait
sabsenter
cette
heure
nana
très
tourmentée
nétait
guère
à
la
rigolade
il
lui
fallait
de
largent
quand
la
tricon
navait
pas
besoin
delle
ce
qui
arrivait
trop
souvent
elle
ne
savait
où
donner
de
son
corps
alors
cétait
avec
satin
des
sorties
enragées
sur
le
pavé
de
paris
dans
ce
vice
den
bas
qui
rôde
le
long
des
ruelles
boueuses
sous
la
clarté
trouble
du
gaz
nana
retourna
dans
les
bastringues
de
barrière
où
elle
avait
fait
sauter
ses
premiers
jupons
sales
elle
revit
les
coins
noirs
des
boulevards
extérieurs
les
bornes
sur
lesquelles
des
hommes
à
quinze
ans
lembrassaient
lorsque
son
père
la
cherchait
pour
lui
enlever
le
derrière
toutes
deux
couraient
faisaient
les
bals
et
les
cafés
dun
quartier
grimpant
des
escaliers
humides
de
crachats
et
de
bière
renversée
ou
bien
elles
marchaient
doucement
elles
remontaient
les
rues
se
plantaient
debout
contre
les
portes
cochères
satin
qui
avait
débuté
au
quartier
latin
conduisit
nana
à
bullier
et
dans
les
brasseries
du
boulevard
saintmichel
mais
les
vacances
arrivaient
le
quartier
sentait
trop
la
dèche
et
elles
revenaient
toujours
aux
grands
boulevards
cétait
encore
là
quelles
avaient
le
plus
de
chance
des
hauteurs
de
montmartre
au
plateau
de
lobservatoire
elles
battaient
ainsi
la
ville
entière
soirées
de
pluie
où
les
bottines
séculaient
soirées
chaudes
qui
collaient
les
corsages
sur
la
peau
longues
factions
promenades
sans
fin
bousculades
et
querelles
brutalités
dernières
dun
passant
emmené
dans
quelque
garni
borgne
et
redescendant
les
marches
grasses
avec
des
jurons
lété
finissait
un
été
orageux
aux
nuits
brûlantes
elles
partaient
ensemble
après
le
dîner
vers
neuf
heures
sur
les
trottoirs
de
la
rue
notredamedelorette
deux
files
de
femmes
rasant
les
boutiques
les
jupons
troussés
le
nez
à
terre
se
hâtaient
vers
les
boulevards
dun
air
affairé
sans
un
coup
doeil
aux
étalages
cétait
la
descente
affamée
du
quartier
bréda
dans
les
premières
flammes
du
gaz
nana
et
satin
longeaient
léglise
prenaient
toujours
par
la
rue
le
peletier
puis
à
cent
mètres
du
café
riche
comme
elles
arrivaient
sur
le
champ
de
manoeuvres
elles
rabattaient
la
queue
de
leur
robe
relevée
jusquelà
dune
main
soigneuse
et
dès
lors
risquant
la
poussière
balayant
les
trottoirs
et
roulant
la
taille
elles
sen
allaient
à
petits
pas
elles
ralentissaient
encore
leur
marche
lorsquelles
traversaient
le
coup
de
lumière
crue
dun
grand
café
rengorgées
le
rire
haut
avec
des
regards
en
arrière
sur
les
hommes
qui
se
retournaient
elles
étaient
chez
elles
leurs
visages
blanchis
tachés
du
rouge
des
lèvres
et
du
noir
des
paupières
prenaient
dans
lombre
le
charme
troublant
dun
orient
de
bazar
à
treize
sous
lâché
au
plein
air
de
la
rue
jusqu
à
onze
heures
parmi
les
heurts
de
la
foule
elles
restaient
gaies
jetant
simplement
un
sale
mufe
de
loin
en
loin
derrière
le
dos
des
maladroits
dont
le
talon
leur
arrachait
un
volant
elles
échangeaient
de
petits
saluts
familiers
avec
des
garçons
de
café
sarrêtaient
à
causer
devant
une
table
acceptaient
des
consommations
quelles
buvaient
lentement
en
personnes
heureuses
de
sasseoir
pour
attendre
la
sortie
des
théâtres
mais
à
mesure
que
la
nuit
savançait
si
elles
navaient
pas
fait
un
ou
deux
voyages
rue
la
rochefoucauld
elles
tournaient
à
la
sale
garce
leur
chasse
devenait
plus
âpre
il
avait
au
pied
des
arbres
le
long
des
boulevards
assombris
qui
se
vidaient
des
marchandages
féroces
des
gros
mots
et
des
coups
pendant
que
dhonnêtes
familles
le
père
la
mère
et
les
filles
habitués
à
ces
rencontres
passaient
tranquillement
sans
presser
le
pas
puis
après
être
allées
dix
fois
de
lopéra
au
gymnase
nana
et
satin
lorsque
décidément
les
hommes
se
dégageaient
et
filaient
plus
vite
dans
lobscurité
croissante
sen
tenaient
aux
trottoirs
de
la
rue
du
faubourgmontmartre
là
jusqu
à
deux
heures
des
restaurants
des
brasseries
des
charcutiers
flambaient
tout
un
grouillement
de
femmes
sentêtait
sur
la
porte
des
cafés
dernier
coin
allumé
et
vivant
du
paris
nocturne
dernier
marché
ouvert
aux
accords
dune
nuit
où
les
affaires
se
traitaient
parmi
les
groupes
crûment
dun
bout
de
la
rue
à
lautre
comme
dans
le
corridor
largement
ouvert
dune
maison
publique
et
les
soirs
où
elles
revenaient
à
vide
elles
se
disputaient
entre
elles
la
rue
notredamedelorette
sétendait
noire
et
déserte
des
ombres
de
femmes
se
traînaient
cétait
la
rentrée
attardée
du
quartier
les
pauvres
filles
exaspérées
dune
nuit
de
chômage
sobstinant
discutant
encore
dune
voix
enrouée
avec
quelque
ivrogne
perdu
quelles
retenaient
à
langle
de
la
rue
bréda
ou
de
la
rue
fontaine
cependant
il
avait
de
bonnes
aubaines
des
louis
attrapés
avec
des
messieurs
bien
qui
montaient
en
mettant
leur
décoration
dans
la
poche
satin
surtout
avait
le
nez
les
soirs
humides
lorsque
paris
mouillé
exhalait
une
odeur
fade
de
grande
alcôve
mal
tenue
elle
savait
que
ce
temps
mou
cette
fétidité
des
coins
louches
enrageaient
les
hommes
et
elle
guettait
les
mieux
mis
elle
voyait
ça
à
leurs
yeux
pâles
cétait
comme
un
coup
de
folie
charnelle
passant
sur
la
ville
elle
avait
bien
un
peu
peur
car
les
plus
comme
il
faut
étaient
les
plus
sales
tout
le
vernis
craquait
la
bête
se
montrait
exigeante
dans
ses
goûts
monstrueux
raffinant
sa
perversion
aussi
cette
roulure
de
satin
manquaitelle
de
respect
séclatant
devant
la
dignité
des
gens
en
voiture
disant
que
leurs
cochers
étaient
plus
gentils
parce
quils
respectaient
les
femmes
et
quils
ne
les
tuaient
pas
avec
des
idées
de
lautre
monde
la
culbute
des
gens
chics
dans
la
crapule
du
vice
surprenait
encore
nana
qui
gardait
des
préjugés
dont
satin
la
débarrassait
alors
comme
elle
le
disait
lorsquelle
causait
gravement
il
n
avait
donc
plus
de
vertu
du
haut
en
bas
se
roulait
eh
bien
ça
devait
être
du
propre
dans
paris
de
neuf
heures
du
soir
à
trois
heures
du
matin
et
elle
rigolait
elle
criait
que
si
lon
avait
pu
voir
dans
toutes
les
chambres
aurait
assisté
à
quelque
chose
de
drôle
le
petit
monde
sen
donnant
pardessus
les
oreilles
et
pas
mal
de
grands
personnages
çà
et
là
le
nez
enfoncé
dans
la
cochonnerie
plus
profondément
que
les
autres
ça
complétait
son
éducation
un
soir
en
venant
prendre
satin
elle
reconnut
le
marquis
de
chouard
qui
descendait
lescalier
les
jambes
cassées
se
traînant
sur
la
rampe
avec
une
figure
blanche
elle
feignit
de
se
moucher
puis
en
haut
comme
elle
trouvait
satin
dans
une
saleté
affreuse
le
ménage
lâché
depuis
huit
jours
un
lit
infect
des
pots
qui
traînaient
elle
sétonna
que
celleci
connût
le
marquis
ah
oui
elle
le
connaissait
même
quil
les
avait
joliment
embêtés
elle
et
son
pâtissier
quand
ils
étaient
ensemble
maintenant
il
revenait
de
temps
à
autre
mais
il
lassommait
il
reniflait
dans
tous
les
endroits
pas
propres
jusque
dans
ses
pantoufles
oui
chère
dans
mes
pantoufles
oh
un
vieux
saligaud
il
demande
toujours
des
choses
ce
qui
inquiétait
surtout
nana
cétait
la
sincérité
de
ces
basses
débauches
elle
se
rappelait
ses
comédies
du
plaisir
lorsquelle
était
une
femme
lancée
tandis
quelle
voyait
les
filles
autour
delle
crever
un
peu
tous
les
jours
puis
satin
lui
faisait
une
peur
abominable
de
la
police
elle
était
pleine
dhistoires
sur
ce
sujetlà
autrefois
elle
couchait
avec
un
agent
des
moeurs
pour
quon
la
laissât
tranquille
à
deux
reprises
il
avait
empêché
quon
ne
la
mît
en
carte
et
à
présent
elle
tremblait
car
son
affaire
était
claire
si
la
pinçait
encore
il
fallait
lentendre
les
agents
pour
avoir
des
gratifications
arrêtaient
le
plus
de
femmes
possible
ils
empoignaient
tout
ils
vous
faisaient
taire
dune
gifle
si
lon
criait
certains
dêtre
soutenus
et
récompensés
même
quand
ils
avaient
pris
dans
le
tas
une
honnête
fille
lété
à
douze
ou
quinze
ils
opéraient
des
rafles
sur
le
boulevard
ils
cernaient
un
trottoir
pêchaient
jusqu
à
des
trente
femmes
en
une
soirée
seulement
satin
connaissait
les
endroits
dès
quelle
apercevait
le
nez
des
agents
elle
senvolait
au
milieu
de
la
débandade
effarée
des
longues
queues
fuyant
à
travers
la
foule
cétait
une
épouvante
de
la
loi
une
terreur
de
la
préfecture
si
grande
que
certaines
restaient
paralysées
sur
la
porte
des
cafés
dans
le
coup
de
force
qui
balayait
lavenue
mais
satin
redoutait
davantage
les
dénonciations
son
pâtissier
sétait
montré
assez
mufe
pour
la
menacer
de
la
vendre
lorsquelle
lavait
quitté
oui
des
hommes
vivaient
sur
leurs
maîtresses
avec
ce
truclà
sans
compter
de
sales
femmes
qui
vous
livraient
très
bien
par
traîtrise
si
lon
était
plus
jolie
quelles
nana
écoutait
ces
choses
prise
de
frayeurs
croissantes
elle
avait
toujours
tremblé
devant
la
loi
cette
puissance
inconnue
cette
vengeance
des
hommes
qui
pouvaient
la
supprimer
sans
que
personne
au

lui
apparaissait
comme
une
fosse
un
trou
noir
où
lon
enterrait
les
femmes
vivantes
après
leur
avoir
coupé
les
cheveux
elle
se
disait
bien
quil
lui
aurait
suffi
de
lâcher
fontan
pour
trouver
des
protections
satin
avait
beau
lui
parler
de
certaines
listes
de
femmes
accompagnées
de
photographies
que
les
agents
devaient
consulter
avec
défense
de
jamais
toucher
à
celleslà
elle
nen
gardait
pas
moins
un
tremblement
elle
se
voyait
toujours
bousculée
traînée
jetée
le
lendemain
à
la
visite
et
ce
fauteuil
de
la
visite
lemplissait
dangoisse
et
de
honte
elle
qui
avait
lancé
vingt
fois
sa
chemise
pardessus
les
moulins
justement
vers
la
fin
de
septembre
un
soir
quelle
se
promenait
avec
satin
sur
le
boulevard
poissonnière
celleci
tout
dun
coup
se
mit
à
galoper
et
comme
elle
linterrogeait
les
agents
soufflatelle
hue
donc
hue
donc
ce
fut
au
milieu
de
la
cohue
une
course
folle
des
jupes
fuyaient
se
déchiraient
il
eut
des
coups
et
des
cris
une
femme
tomba
la
foule
regardait
avec
des
rires
la
brutale
agression
des
agents
qui
rapidement
resserraient
leur
cercle
cependant
nana
avait
perdu
satin
les
jambes
mortes
elle
allait
sûrement
être
arrêtée
lorsquun
homme
layant
prise
à
son
bras
lemmena
devant
les
agents
furieux
cétait
prullière
qui
venait
de
la
reconnaître
sans
parler
il
tourna
avec
elle
dans
la
rue
rougemont
alors
déserte
où
elle
put
souffler
si
défaillante
quil
dut
la
soutenir
elle
ne
le
remerciait
seulement
pas
voyons
ditil
enfin
il
faut
te
remettre
monte
chez
moi
il
logeait
à
côté
rue
bergère
mais
elle
se
redressa
aussitôt
non
je
ne
veux
pas
alors
il
devint
grossier
reprenant
puisque
tout
le
monde
passe
hein
pourquoi
ne
veuxtu
pas
parce
que
cela
disait
tout
dans
son
idée
elle
aimait
trop
fontan
pour
le
trahir
avec
un
ami
les
autres
ne
comptaient
pas
du
moment
quil
n
avait
pas
de
plaisir
et
que
cétait
par
nécessité
devant
cet
entêtement
stupide
prullière
commit
une
lâcheté
de
joli
homme
vexé
dans
son
amourpropre
eh
bien
à
ton
aise
déclaratil
seulement
je
ne
vais
pas
de
ton
côté
chère
tiretoi
daffaire
toute
seule
et
il
labandonna
son
épouvante
la
reprit
elle
fit
un
détour
énorme
pour
rentrer
à
montmartre
filant
raide
le
long
des
boutiques
pâlissant
dès
quun
homme
sapprochait
delle
ce
fut
le
lendemain
dans
lébranlement
de
ses
terreurs
de
la
veille
que
nana
en
allant
chez
sa
tante
se
trouva
nez
à
nez
avec
labordette
au
fond
dune
petite
rue
solitaire
des
batignolles
dabord
lun
et
lautre
parurent
gênés
lui
toujours
complaisant
avait
des
affaires
quil
cachait
pourtant
il
se
remit
le
premier
il
sexclama
sur
la
bonne
rencontre
vrai
tout
le
monde
était
encore
stupéfait
de
léclipse
totale
de
nana
la
réclamait
les
anciens
amis
séchaient
sur
pied
et
se
faisant
paternel
il
finit
par
la
sermonner
entre
nous
chère
franchement
ça
devient
bête
comprend
une
toquade
seulement
en
venir
là
être
grugée
à
ce
point
et
nempocher
que
des
gifles
tu
poses
donc
pour
les
prix
de
vertu
elle
lécoutait
dun
air
embarrassé
cependant
lorsquil
lui
parla
de
rose
qui
triomphait
avec
sa
conquête
du
comte
muffat
une
flamme
passa
dans
ses
yeux
elle
murmura
oh
si
je
voulais
il
proposa
tout
de
suite
son
entremise
en
ami
obligeant
mais
elle
refusa
alors
il
lattaqua
par
un
autre
point
il
lui
apprit
que
bordenave
montait
une
pièce
de
fauchery
où
il
avait
un
rôle
superbe
pour
elle
comment
une
pièce
où
il
un
rôle
sécriatelle
stupéfaite
mais
il
en
est
et
il
ne
rien
dit
elle
ne
nommait
pas
fontan
dailleurs
elle
se
calma
tout
de
suite
jamais
elle
ne
rentrerait
au
théâtre
sans
doute
labordette
nétait
pas
convaincu
car
il
insistait
avec
un
sourire
tu
sais
quon
n
rien
à
craindre
avec
moi
je
prépare
ton
muffat
tu
rentres
au
théâtre
et
je
te
lamène
par
la
patte
non
ditelle
énergiquement
et
elle
le
quitta
son
héroïsme
lattendrissait
sur
ellemême
ce
nétait
pas
un
mufe
dhomme
qui
se
serait
sacrifié
comme
ça
sans
le
trompeter
pourtant
une
chose
la
frappait
labordette
venait
de
lui
donner
exactement
les
mêmes
conseils
que
francis
le
soir
lorsque
fontan
rentra
elle
le
questionna
sur
la
pièce
de
fauchery
lui
depuis
deux
mois
avait
fait
sa
rentrée
aux
variétés
pourquoi
ne
lui
avaitil
pas
parlé
du
rôle
quel
rôle
ditil
de
sa
voix
mauvaise
ce
nest
pas
le
rôle
de
la
grande
dame
peutêtre
ah
ça
tu
te
crois
donc
du
talent
mais
ce
rôlelà
fille
técraserait
vrai
tu
es
comique
elle
fut
horriblement
blessée
toute
la
soirée
il
la
blagua
en
lappelant
mademoiselle
mars
et
plus
il
tapait
sur
elle
plus
elle
tenait
bon
goûtant
une
jouissance
amère
dans
cet
héroïsme
de
sa
toquade
qui
la
rendait
très
grande
et
très
amoureuse
à
ses
propres
yeux
depuis
quelle
allait
avec
dautres
pour
le
nourrir
elle
laimait
davantage
de
toute
la
fatigue
et
de
tous
les
dégoûts
quelle
rapportait
il
devenait
son
vice
quelle
payait
son
besoin
dont
elle
ne
pouvait
se
passer
sous
laiguillon
des
gifles
lui
en
voyant
la
bonne
bête
finissait
par
abuser
elle
lui
donnait
sur
les
nerfs
il
se
prenait
dune
haine
féroce
au
point
de
ne
plus
tenir
compte
de
ses
intérêts
lorsque
bosc
lui
adressait
des
observations
il
criait
exaspéré
sans
quon
sût
pourquoi
quil
se
fichait
delle
et
de
ses
bons
dîners
quil
la
flanquerait
dehors
rien
que
pour
faire
cadeau
de
ses
sept
mille
francs
à
une
autre
femme
et
ce
fut
là
le
dénouement
de
leur
liaison
un
soir
nana
en
rentrant
vers
onze
heures
trouva
la
porte
fermée
au
verrou
elle
tapa
une
première
fois
pas
de
réponse
une
seconde
fois
toujours
pas
de
réponse
cependant
elle
voyait
de
la
lumière
sous
la
porte
et
fontan
à
lintérieur
ne
se
gênait
pas
pour
marcher
elle
tapa
encore
sans
se
lasser
appelant
se
fâchant
enfin
la
voix
de
fontan
séleva
lente
et
grasse
et
ne
lâcha
quun
mot
merde
elle
tapa
des
deux
poings
merde
elle
tapa
plus
fort
à
fendre
le
bois
merde
et
pendant
un
quart
dheure
la
même
ordure
la
souffleta
répondit
comme
un
écho
goguenard
à
chacun
des
coups
dont
elle
ébranlait
la
porte
puis
voyant
quelle
ne
se
lassait
pas
il
ouvrit
brusquement
il
se
campa
sur
le
seuil
les
bras
croisés
et
dit
de
la
même
voix
froidement
brutale
nom
de
dieu
avezvous
fini
questce
que
vous
voulez
hein
allezvous
nous
laisser
dormir
vous
voyez
bien
que
jai
du
monde
il
nétait
pas
seul
en
effet
nana
aperçut
la
petite
femme
des
bouffes
déjà
en
chemise
avec
ses
cheveux
filasse
ébouriffés
et
ses
yeux
en
trou
de
vrille
qui
rigolait
au
milieu
de
ces
meubles
quelle
avait
payés
mais
fontan
faisait
un
pas
sur
le
carré
lair
terrible
ouvrant
ses
gros
doigts
comme
des
pinces
file
ou
je
tétrangle
alors
nana
éclata
en
sanglots
nerveux
elle
eut
peur
et
se
sauva
cette
fois
cétait
elle
quon
flanquait
dehors
lidée
de
muffat
lui
vint
tout
dun
coup
dans
sa
rage
mais
vrai
ce
nétait
pas
fontan
qui
aurait
dû
lui
rendre
la
pareille
sur
le
trottoir
sa
première
pensée
fut
daller
coucher
avec
satin
si
celleci
navait
personne
elle
la
rencontra
devant
sa
maison
jetée
elle
aussi
sur
le
pavé
par
son
propriétaire
qui
venait
de
faire
poser
un
cadenas
à
sa
porte
contre
tout
droit
puisquelle
était
dans
ses
meubles
elle
jurait
elle
parlait
de
le
traîner
chez
le
commissaire
en
attendant
comme
minuit
sonnait
il
fallait
songer
à
trouver
un
lit
et
satin
jugeant
prudent
de
ne
pas
mettre
les
sergents
de
ville
dans
ses
affaires
finit
par
emmener
nana
rue
de
laval
chez
une
dame
qui
tenait
un
petit
hôtel
meublé
leur
donna
au
premier
étage
une
étroite
chambre
dont
la
fenêtre
ouvrait
sur
la
cour
satin
répétait
je
serais
bien
allée
chez
madame
robert
il
toujours
un
coin
pour
moi
mais
avec
toi
pas
possible
elle
devient
ridicule
de
jalousie
lautre
soir
elle
battue
quand
elles
se
furent
enfermées
nana
qui
ne
sétait
pas
soulagée
encore
fondit
en
larmes
et
raconta
à
vingt
reprises
la
saleté
de
fontan
satin
lécoutait
avec
complaisance
la
consolait
sindignait
plus
fort
quelle
tapant
sur
les
hommes
oh
les
cochons
oh
les
cochons
voistu
nen
faut
plus
de
ces
cochonslà
puis
elle
aida
nana
à
se
déshabiller
elle
eut
autour
delle
des
airs
de
petite
femme
prévenante
et
soumise
elle
répétait
avec
câlinerie
couchonsnous
vite
mon
chat
nous
serons
mieux
ah
que
tu
es
bête
de
te
faire
de
la
bile
je
te
dis
que
ce
sont
des
salauds
ne
pense
plus
à
eux
moi
je
taime
bien
ne
pleure
pas
fais
ça
pour
ta
petite
chérie
et
dans
le
lit
elle
prit
tout
de
suite
nana
entre
ses
bras
afin
de
la
calmer
elle
ne
voulait
plus
entendre
le
nom
de
fontan
chaque
fois
quil
revenait
sur
les
lèvres
de
son
amie
elle
l
arrêtait
dun
baiser
avec
une
jolie
moue
de
colère
les
cheveux
dénoués
dune
beauté
enfantine
et
noyée
dattendrissement
alors
peu
à
peu
dans
cette
étreinte
si
douce
nana
essuya
ses
larmes
elle
était
touchée
elle
rendait
à
satin
ses
caresses
lorsque
deux
heures
sonnèrent
la
bougie
brûlait
encore
toutes
deux
avaient
de
légers
rires
étouffés
avec
des
paroles
damour
mais
brusquement
à
un
vacarme
qui
monta
dans
lhôtel
satin
se
leva
deminue
prêtant
loreille
la
police
ditelle
toute
blanche
ah
nom
dun
chien
pas
de
chance
nous
sommes
foutues
vingt
fois
elle
avait
conté
les
descentes
que
les
agents
faisaient
dans
les
hôtels
et
justement
cette
nuitlà
en
se
réfugiant
rue
de
laval
ni
lune
ni
lautre
ne
sétait
méfiée
au
mot
de
police
nana
avait
perdu
la
tête
elle
sauta
du
lit
courut
à
travers
la
chambre
ouvrit
la
fenêtre
de
lair
égaré
dune
folle
qui
va
se
précipiter
mais
heureusement
la
petite
cour
était
vitrée
un
grillage
en
fil
de
fer
se
trouvait
là
de
plainpied
alors
elle
nhésita
point
elle
enjamba
lappui
et
disparut
dans
le
noir
la
chemise
volante
les
cuisses
à
lair
de
la
nuit
reste
donc
répétait
satin
effrayée
tu
vas
te
tuer
puis
comme
cognait
à
la
porte
elle
fut
bonne
fille
repoussant
la
fenêtre
jetant
les
vêtements
de
son
amie
au
fond
dune
armoire
déjà
elle
sétait
résignée
en
se
disant
quaprès
tout
si
la
mettait
en
carte
elle
naurait
plus
cette
bête
de
peur
elle
joua
la
femme
écrasée
de
sommeil
bâilla
parlementa
finit
par
ouvrir
à
un
grand
gaillard
la
barbe
sale
qui
lui
dit
montrez
vos
mains
vous
navez
pas
de
piqûres
vous
ne
travaillez
pas
allons
habillezvous
mais
je
ne
suis
pas
couturière
je
suis
brunisseuse
déclara
satin
avec
effronterie
dailleurs
elle
shabilla
docilement
sachant
quil
n
avait
pas
de
discussion
possible
des
cris
sélevaient
dans
lhôtel
une
fille
se
cramponnait
aux
portes
refusant
de
marcher
une
autre
qui
était
couchée
avec
un
amant
et
dont
celuici
répondait
faisait
la
femme
honnête
outragée
parlait
dintenter
un
procès
au
préfet
de
police
pendant
près
dune
heure
ce
fut
un
bruit
de
gros
souliers
sur
les
marches
des
portes
ébranlées
à
coups
de
poing
des
querelles
aiguës
sétouffant
dans
des
sanglots
des
glissements
de
jupes
frôlant
les
murs
tout
le
réveil
brusque
et
le
départ
effaré
dun
troupeau
de
femmes
brutalement
emballées
par
trois
agents
sous
la
conduite
dun
petit
commissaire
blond
très
poli
puis
lhôtel
retomba
à
un
grand
silence
personne
ne
lavait
vendue
nana
était
sauvée
elle
rentra
à
tâtons
dans
la
chambre
grelottante
morte
de
peur
ses
pieds
nus
saignaient
déchirés
par
le
grillage
longtemps
elle
resta
assise
au
bord
du
lit
écoutant
toujours
vers
le
matin
pourtant
elle
sendormit
mais
à
huit
heures
lorsquelle
séveilla
elle
se
sauva
de
lhôtel
et
courut
chez
sa
tante
quand
madame
lerat
qui
justement
prenait
son
café
au
lait
avec
zoé
laperçut
à
cette
heure
faite
comme
une
souillon
la
figure
renversée
elle
comprit
tout
de
suite

bien
dit
quil

zoé
sétait
levée
murmurant
avec
une
familiarité
respectueuse
enfin
madame
nous
est
rendue
jattendais
madame
mais
madame
lerat
voulut
que
nana
embrassât
tout
de
suite
louiset
parce
que
disaitelle
cétait
son
bonheur
à
cet
enfant
que
la
sagesse
de
sa
mère
louiset
dormait
encore
maladif
le
sang
pauvre
et
lorsque
nana
se
pencha
sur
sa
face
blanche
et
scrofuleuse
tous
ses
embêtements
des
derniers
mois
la
reprirent
à
la
gorge
et
létranglèrent
oh
mon
pauvre
petit
mon
pauvre
petit
bégayatelle
dans
une
dernière
crise
de
sanglots
ix
répétait
aux
variétés
la
petite
duchesse
le
premier
acte
venait
dêtre
débrouillé
et
lon
allait
commencer
le
second
lavantscène
dans
de
vieux
fauteuils

et
bordenave
discutaient
tandis
que
le
souffleur
le
père
cossard
un
petit
bossu
assis
sur
une
chaise
de
paille
feuilletait
le
manuscrit
un
crayon
aux
lèvres
eh

cria
tout
à

heures
mais

une
belle
tranquillité

remettant
à
jurer
et
à
enfoncer

pourtant

dos
rond
sous
lorage
et
la
répétition
commença
simonne
en
chapeau
couverte
de
sa
fourrure
prenait
des
airs
de
servante
qui
range
des
meubles
elle
sinterrompit
pour
dire

la
répétition
continua
bordenave
renfrogné
glissé
au
fond
de
son
fauteuil

dun
air
de
lassitude
fauchery
nerveux
changeait
de
position
avait
à
chaque
minute
des
démangeaisons
dinterrompre
quil
réprimait
mais
derrière
lui
dans
la
salle
noire
et
vide
il
entendit
un
chuchotement
estce
quelle

répondit
affirmativement
dun
signe
de
tête
avant
daccepter
le
rôle
de
géraldine
quil
lui
offrait
nana
avait
voulu
voir
la
pièce
car
elle
hésitait
à
jouer
encore
un
rôle
de
cocotte
cétait
un
rôle
dhonnête
femme
quelle
rêvait
elle
se
cachait
dans
lombre
dune
baignoire
avec
labordette
qui
semployait
pour
elle
auprès
de
bordenave
fauchery
la
chercha
dun
coup
doeil
et
se
remit
à
suivre
la
répétition
seule
lavantscène
était
éclairée
une
servante
une
flamme
de
gaz
prise
à
lembranchement
de
la
rampe
et
dont
un
réflecteur
jetait
toute
la
clarté
sur
les
premiers
plans
semblait
un
grand
oeil
jaune
ouvert
dans
la
demiobscurité
où
il
flambait
avec
une
tristesse
louche
contre
la
mince
tige
de
la
servante
cossard
levait
le
manuscrit
pour
voir
clair
en
plein
sous
le
coup
de
lumière
qui
accusait
le
relief
de
sa
bosse
puis
bordenave
et
fauchery
déjà
se
noyaient
cétait
au
milieu
de
lénorme
vaisseau
et
sur
quelques
mètres
seulement
une
lueur
de
falot
cloué
au
poteau
dune
gare
dans
laquelle
les
acteurs
prenaient
des
airs
de
visions
baroques
avec
leurs
ombres
dansant
derrière
eux
le
reste
de
la
scène
semplissait
dune
fumée
pareil
à
un
chantier
de
démolitions
à
une
nef
éventrée
encombrée
déchelles
de
châssis
de
décors
dont
les
peintures
déteintes
faisaient
comme
des
entassements
de
décombres
et
en
lair
les
toiles
de
fond
qui
pendaient
avaient
une
apparence
de
guenilles
accrochées
aux
poutres
de
quelque
vaste
magasin
de
chiffons
tout
en
haut
un
rayon
de
clair
soleil
tombé
dune
fenêtre
coupait
dune
barre
dor
la
nuit
du
cintre
cependant
au
fond
de
la
scène
des
acteurs
causaient
en
attendant
leurs
répliques
peu
à
peu
ils
avaient
élevé
la
voix
ah
ça
voulezvous
vous
taire
hurla
bordenave
qui
sauta
rageusement
dans
son
fauteuil
je
nentends
pas
un
mot
allez
dehors
si
vous
avez
à
causer
nous
autres
nous
travaillons
barillot
si
lon
parle
encore
je
flanque
tout
le
monde
à
lamende
ils
se
turent
un
instant
ils
formaient
un
petit
groupe
assis
sur
un
banc
et
des
chaises
rustiques
dans
un
coin
de
jardin
le
premier
décor
du
soir
qui
était
là
prêt
à
être
planté
fontan
et
prullière
écoutaient
rose
mignon
à
laquelle
le
directeur
des
foliesdramatiques
venait
de
faire
des
offres
superbes
mais
une
voix
cria
la
duchesse
saintfirmin
allons
la
duchesse
et
saintfirmin
au
second
appel
seulement
prullière
se
rappela
quil
était
saintfirmin
rose
qui
jouait
la
duchesse
hélène
lattendait
déjà
pour
leur
entrée
lentement
traînant
les
pieds
sur
les
planches
vides
et
sonores
le
vieux
bosc
retournait
sasseoir
alors
clarisse
lui
offrit
la
moitié
du
banc
qu
atil
donc
à
gueuler
comme
ça
ditelle
en
parlant
de
bordenave
ça
va
être
gentil
tout
à
lheure
ne
peut
plus
monter
une
pièce
sans
quil
ait
ses
nerfs
maintenant
bosc
haussa
les
épaules
il
était
audessus
de
tous
les
orages
fontan
murmurait
il
flaire
un
four
ça
lair
idiot
cette
pièce
puis
sadressant
à
clarisse
revenant
à
lhistoire
de
rose
hein
tu
crois
aux
offres
des
folies
toi
trois
cents
francs
par
soir
et
pendant
cent
représentations
pourquoi
pas
une
maison
de
campagne
avec
si
lon
donnait
trois
cents
francs
à
sa
femme
mignon
lâcherait
mon
bordenave
et
raide
clarisse
croyait
aux
trois
cents
francs
ce
fontan
cassait
toujours
du
sucre
sur
la
tête
des
camarades
mais
simonne
les
interrompit
elle
grelottait
tous
boutonnés
et
des
foulards
au
cou
regardèrent
en
lair
le
rayon
de
soleil
qui
luisait
sans
descendre
dans
le
froid
morne
de
la
scène
dehors
il
gelait
par
un
ciel
clair
de
novembre
et
il
n
pas
de
feu
au
foyer
dit
simonne
cest
dégoûtant
il
devient
dun
rat
moi
jai
envie
de
partir
je
ne
veux
pas
attraper
du
mal
silence
donc
cria
de
nouveau
bordenave
dune
voix
de
tonnerre
alors
pendant
quelques
minutes
nentendit
plus
que
la
récitation
confuse
des
acteurs
ils
indiquaient
à
peine
les
gestes
ils
gardaient
une
voix
blanche
pour
ne
pas
se
fatiguer
cependant
lorsquils
marquaient
une
intention
ils
adressaient
des
coups
doeil
à
la
salle
cétait
devant
eux
un
trou
béant
où
flottait
une
ombre
vague
comme
une
fine
poussière
enfermée
dans
un
haut
grenier
sans
fenêtre
la
salle
éteinte
éclairée
seulement
par
le
demijour
de
la
scène
avait
un
sommeil
un
effacement
mélancolique
et
troublant
au
plafond
une
nuit
opaque
noyait
les
peintures
du
haut
en
bas
des
avantscènes
à
droite
et
à
gauche
tombaient
dimmenses
lés
de
toile
grise
pour
protéger
les
tentures
et
les
housses
continuaient
des
bandes
de
toile
étaient
jetées
sur
le
velours
des
rampes
ceignant
les
galeries
dun
double
linceul
salissant
les
ténèbres
de
leur
ton
blafard
ne
distinguait
dans
la
décoloration
générale
que
les
enfoncements
plus
sombres
des
loges
qui
dessinaient
la
carcasse
des
étages
avec
les
taches
des
fauteuils
dont
le
velours
rouge
tournait
au
noir
le
lustre
complètement
descendu
emplissait
lorchestre
de
ses
pendeloques
faisait
songer
à
un
déménagement
à
un
départ
du
public
pour
un
voyage
dont
il
ne
reviendrait
pas
et
justement
rose
dans
son
rôle
de
petite
duchesse
égarée
chez
une
fille
savançait
vers
la
rampe
à
ce
moment
elle
leva
les
mains
fit
une
moue
adorable
à
cette
salle
vide
et
obscure
dune
tristesse
de
maison
en
deuil
mon
dieu
quel
drôle
de
monde
ditelle
soulignant
la
phrase
certaine
dun
effet
au
fond
de
la
baignoire
où
elle
se
cachait
nana
enveloppée
dans
un
grand
châle
écoutait
la
pièce
en
mangeant
rose
des
yeux
elle
se
tourna
vers
labordette
et
lui
demanda
tout
bas
tu
es
sûr
quil
va
venir
tout
à
fait
sûr
sans
doute
il
arrivera
avec
mignon
pour
avoir
un
prétexte
dès
quil
paraîtra
tu
monteras
dans
la
loge
de
mathilde
où
je
te
le
conduirai
ils
parlaient
du
comte
muffat
cétait
une
entrevue
ménagée
par
labordette
sur
un
terrain
neutre
il
avait
eu
une
conversation
sérieuse
avec
bordenave
que
deux
échecs
successifs
venaient
de
mettre
très
mal
dans
ses
affaires
aussi
bordenave
sétaitil
hâté
de
prêter
son
théâtre
et
doffrir
un
rôle
à
nana
désirant
se
rendre
le
comte
favorable
rêvant
un
emprunt
et
ce
rôle
de
géraldine
quen
distu
reprit
labordette
mais
nana
immobile
ne
répondit
pas
après
un
premier
acte
où
lauteur
posait
comme
quoi
le
duc
de
beaurivage
trompait
sa
femme
avec
la
blonde
géraldine
une
étoile
dopérettes
voyait
au
second
acte
la
duchesse
hélène
venir
chez
lactrice
un
soir
de
bal
masqué
pour
apprendre
par
quel
magique
pouvoir
ces
dames
conquéraient
et
retenaient
leurs
maris
cétait
un
cousin
le
bel
oscar
de
saintfirmin
qui
lintroduisait
espérant
la
débaucher
et
comme
première
leçon
à
sa
grande
surprise
elle
entendait
géraldine
faire
une
querelle
de
charretier
au
duc
très
souple
lair
enchanté
ce
qui
lui
arrachait
ce
cri
ah
bien
si
cest
ainsi
quil
faut
parler
aux
hommes
géraldine
navait
guère
que
cette
scène
dans
lacte
quant
à
la
duchesse
elle
ne
tardait
pas
à
être
punie
de
sa
curiosité
un
vieux
beau
le
baron
de
tardiveau
la
prenait
pour
une
cocotte
et
se
montrait
très
vif
tandis
que
de
lautre
côté
sur
une
chaise
longue
beaurivage
faisait
la
paix
avec
géraldine
en
lembrassant
comme
le
rôle
de
cette
dernière
nétait
pas
distribué
le
père
cossard
sétait
levé
pour
le
lire
et
il
mettait
des
intentions
malgré
lui
il
figurait
dans
les
bras
de
bosc
en
était
à
cette
scène
la
répétition
traînait
sur
un
ton
maussade
lorsque
fauchery
tout
dun
coup
sauta
de
son
fauteuil
il
sétait
contenu
jusquelà
mais
ses
nerfs
lemportaient
ce
nest
pas
ça
criatil
les
acteurs
sarrêtèrent
les
mains
ballantes
fontan
demanda
le
nez
pincé
avec
son
air
de
se
ficher
du
monde
quoi
questce
qui
nest
pas
ça
personne
n
est
mais
pas
du
tout
pas
du
tout
reprit
fauchery
qui
luimême
gesticulant
arpentant
les
planches
se
mit
à
mimer
la
scène
voyons
vous
fontan
comprenez
bien
lemballement
de
tardiveau
il
faut
vous
pencher
avec
ce
geste
pour
saisir
la
duchesse
et
toi
rose
cest
alors
que
tu
fais
ta
passade
vivement
comme
ça
mais
pas
trop
tôt
seulement
quand
tu
entends
le
baiser
il
sinterrompit
il
cria
à
cossard
dans
le
feu
de
ses
explications
géraldine
donnez
le
baiser
fort
pour
quon
entende
bien
le
père
cossard
se
tournant
vers
bosc
fit
claquer
vigoureusement
les
lèvres
bon
voilà
le
baiser
dit
fauchery
triomphant
encore
une
fois
le
baiser
voistu
rose
jai
eu
le
temps
de
passer
et
je
jette
alors
un
léger
cri
ah
elle
l
embrassé
mais
pour
cela
il
faut
que
tardiveau
remonte
entendezvous
fontan
vous
remontez
allons
essayez
ça
et
de
lensemble
les
acteurs
reprirent
la
scène
mais
fontan
mettait
une
telle
mauvaise
volonté
que
ça
ne
marcha
pas
du
tout
deux
reprises
fauchery
dut
revenir
sur
ses
indications
mimant
chaque
fois
avec
plus
de
chaleur
tous
lécoutaient
dun
air
morne
se
regardaient
un
instant
comme
sil
leur
eût
demandé
de
marcher
la
tête
en
bas
puis
gauchement
essayaient
pour
sarrêter
aussitôt
avec
des
rigidités
de
pantins
dont
vient
de
casser
les
fils
non
cest
trop
fort
pour
moi
je
ne
comprends
pas
finit
par
dire
fontan
de
sa
voix
insolente
bordenave
navait
pas
desserré
les
lèvres
glissé
complètement
au
fond
de
son
fauteuil
il
ne
montrait
plus
dans
la
lueur
louche
de
la
servante
que
le
haut
de
son
chapeau
rabattu
sur
ses
yeux
tandis
que
sa
canne
abandonnée
lui
barrait
le
ventre
et
lon
aurait
pu
croire
quil
dormait
brusquement
il
se
redressa
mon
petit
cest
idiot
déclaratil
à
fauchery
dun
air
tranquille
comment
idiot
sécria
lauteur
devenu
très
pâle
idiot
vousmême
mon
cher
du
coup
bordenave
commença
à
se
fâcher
il
répéta
le
mot
idiot
chercha
quelque
chose
de
plus
fort
trouva
imbécile
et
crétin
sifflerait
lacte
ne
finirait
pas
et
comme
fauchery
exaspéré
sans
dailleurs
se
blesser
autrement
de
ces
gros
mots
qui
revenaient
entre
eux
à
chaque
pièce
nouvelle
le
traitait
carrément
de
brute
bordenave
perdit
toute
mesure
il
faisait
le
moulinet
avec
sa
canne
il
soufflait
comme
un
boeuf
criant
nom
de
dieu
foutezmoi
la
paix
voilà
un
quart
dheure
perdu
à
des
stupidités
oui
des
stupidités
ça
n
pas
le
sens
commun
et
cest
si
simple
pourtant
toi
fontan
tu
ne
bouges
pas
toi
rose
tu
ce
petit
mouvement
voistu
pas
davantage
et
tu
descends
allons
marchez
cette
fois
donnez
le
baiser
cossard
alors
ce
fut
une
confusion
la
scène
nallait
pas
mieux
son
tour
bordenave
mimait
avec
des
grâces
déléphant
pendant
que
fauchery
ricanait
en
haussant
les
épaules
de
pitié
puis
fontan
voulut
sen
mêler
bosc
luimême
se
permit
des
conseils
éreintée
rose
avait
fini
par
sasseoir
sur
la
chaise
qui
marquait
la
porte
ne
savait
plus
où
lon
en
était
pour
comble
simonne
ayant
cru
entendre
sa
réplique
fit
trop
tôt
son
entrée
au
milieu
du
désordre
ce
qui
enragea
bordenave
à
un
tel
point
que
la
canne
lancée
dans
un
moulinet
terrible
il
lui
en
allongea
un
grand
coup
sur
le
derrière
souvent
il
battait
les
femmes
aux
répétitions
quand
il
avait
couché
avec
elles
elle
se
sauva
poursuivie
par
ce
cri
furieux
mets
ça
dans
ta
poche
et
nom
de
dieu
je
ferme
la
baraque
si
lon
membête
encore
fauchery
venait
denfoncer
son
chapeau
sur
sa
tête
en
faisant
mine
de
quitter
le
théâtre
mais
il
demeura
au
fond
de
la
scène
et
redescendit
lorsquil
vit
bordenave
se
rasseoir
en
nage
luimême
reprit
sa
place
dans
lautre
fauteuil
ils
restèrent
un
moment
côte
à
côte
sans
bouger
tandis
quun
lourd
silence
tombait
dans
lombre
de
la
salle
les
acteurs
attendirent
près
de
deux
minutes
tous
avaient
un
accablement
comme
sils
sortaient
dune
besogne
écrasante
eh
bien
continuons
dit
enfin
bordenave
de
sa
voix
ordinaire
parfaitement
calme
oui
continuons
répéta
fauchery
nous
réglerons
la
scène
demain
et
ils
sallongèrent
la
répétition
reprenait
son
train
dennui
et
de
belle
indifférence
durant
lattrapage
entre
le
directeur
et
lauteur
fontan
et
les
autres
sétaient
fait
du
bon
sang
au
fond
sur
le
banc
et
les
chaises
rustiques
ils
avaient
de
petits
rires
des
grognements
des
mots
féroces
mais
quand
simonne
revint
avec
son
coup
de
canne
sur
le
derrière
la
voix
coupée
de
larmes
ils
tournèrent
au
drame
ils
dirent
qu
à
sa
place
ils
auraient
étranglé
ce
cochonlà
elle
sessuyait
les
yeux
en
approuvant
de
la
tête
cétait
fini
elle
le
lâchait
dautant
plus
que
steiner
la
veille
lui
avait
offert
de
la
lancer
clarisse
resta
surprise
le
banquier
navait
plus
un
sou
mais
prullière
se
mit
à
rire
et
rappela
le
tour
de
ce
sacré
juif
lorsquil
sétait
affiché
avec
rose
pour
poser
à
la
bourse
son
affaire
des
salines
des
landes
justement
il
promenait
un
nouveau
projet
un
tunnel
sous
le
bosphore
simonne
écoutait
très
intéressée
quant
à
clarisse
elle
ne
dérageait
pas
depuis
une
semaine
estce
que
cet
animal
de
la
faloise
quelle
avait
balancé
en
le
collant
dans
les
bras
vénérables
de
gaga
nallait
pas
hériter
dun
oncle
très
riche
cétait
fait
pour
elle
toujours
elle
avait
essuyé
les
plâtres
puis
cette
saleté
de
bordenave
lui
donnait
encore
une
panne
un
rôle
de
cinquante
lignes
comme
si
elle
naurait
pas
pu
jouer
géraldine
elle
rêvait
de
ce
rôle
elle
espérait
bien
que
nana
refuserait
eh
bien
et
moi
dit
prullière
très
pincé
je
nai
pas
deux
cents
lignes
je
voulais
rendre
le
rôle
cest
indigne
de
faire
jouer
ce
saintfirmin
une
vraie
veste
et
quel
style
mes
enfants
vous
savez
que
ça
va
tomber
à
plat
mais
simonne
qui
causait
avec
le
père
barillot
revint
dire
essoufflée
propos
de
nana
elle
est
dans
la
salle
où
donc
demanda
vivement
clarisse
en
se
levant
pour
voir
le
bruit
courut
tout
de
suite
chacun
se
penchait
la
répétition
fut
un
instant
comme
interrompue
mais
bordenave
sortit
de
son
immobilité
criant
quoi
quarrivetil
finissez
donc
lacte
et
silence
làbas
cest
insupportable
dans
la
baignoire
nana
suivait
toujours
la
pièce
deux
fois
labordette
avait
voulu
causer
mais
elle
sétait
impatientée
en
le
poussant
du
coude
pour
le
faire
taire
achevait
le
second
acte
lorsque
deux
ombres
parurent
au
fond
du
théâtre
comme
elles
descendaient
sur
la
pointe
des
pieds
évitant
le
bruit
nana
reconnut
mignon
et
le
comte
muffat
qui
vinrent
saluer
silencieusement
bordenave
ah
les
voilà
murmuratelle
avec
un
soupir
de
soulagement
rose
mignon
donna
la
dernière
réplique
alors
bordenave
dit
quil
fallait
recommencer
ce
deuxième
acte
avant
de
passer
au
troisième
et
lâchant
la
répétition
il
accueillit
le
comte
dun
air
de
politesse
exagérée
pendant
que
fauchery
affectait
dêtre
tout
à
ses
acteurs
groupés
autour
de
lui
mignon
sifflotait
les
mains
derrière
le
dos
couvrant
des
yeux
sa
femme
qui
paraissait
nerveuse
eh
bien
montonsnous
demanda
labordette
à
nana
je
tinstalle
dans
la
loge
et
je
redescends
le
prendre
nana
quitta
tout
de
suite
la
baignoire
elle
dut
suivre
à
tâtons
le
couloir
des
fauteuils
dorchestre
mais
bordenave
la
devina
comme
elle
filait
dans
lombre
et
il
la
rattrapa
au
bout
du
corridor
qui
passait
derrière
la
scène
un
étroit
boyau
où
le
gaz
brûlait
nuit
et
jour
là
pour
brusquer
laffaire
il
semballa
sur
le
rôle
de
la
cocotte
hein
quel
rôle
quel
chien
cest
fait
pour
toi
viens
répéter
demain
nana
restait
froide
elle
voulait
connaître
le
troisième
acte
oh
superbe
le
troisième
la
duchesse
fait
la
cocotte
chez
elle
ce
qui
dégoûte
beaurivage
et
le
corrige
avec
ça
un
quiproquo
très
drôle
tardiveau
arrivant
et
se
croyant
chez
une
danseuse
et
géraldine
làdedans
interrompit
nana
géraldine
répéta
bordenave
un
peu
gêné
elle
une
scène
pas
longue
mais
très
réussie
cest
fait
pour
toi
je
te
dis
signestu
elle
le
regardait
fixement
enfin
elle
répondit
tout
à
lheure
nous
verrons
ça
et
elle
rejoignit
labordette
qui
lattendait
dans
lescalier
tout
le
théâtre
lavait
reconnue
chuchotait
prullière
scandalisé
de
cette
rentrée
clarisse
très
inquiète
pour
le
rôle
quant
à
fontan
il
jouait
lindifférence
lair
froid
car
ce
nétait
pas
à
lui
de
taper
sur
une
femme
quil
avait
aimée
au
fond
dans
son
ancienne
toquade
tournée
à
la
haine
il
lui
gardait
une
rancune
féroce
de
ses
dévouements
de
sa
beauté
de
cette
vie
à
deux
dont
il
navait
plus
voulu
par
une
perversion
de
ses
goûts
de
monstre
cependant
lorsque
labordette
reparut
et
quil
sapprocha
du
comte
rose
mignon
mise
en
éveil
par
la
présence
de
nana
comprit
tout
dun
coup
muffat
lassommait
mais
la
pensée
dêtre
lâchée
ainsi
la
jeta
hors
delle
elle
sortit
du
silence
quelle
gardait
dordinaire
sur
ces
choses
avec
son
mari
elle
lui
dit
crûment
tu
vois
ce
qui
se
passe
parole
si
elle
recommence
le
tour
de
steiner
je
lui
arrache
les
yeux
mignon
tranquille
et
superbe
haussa
les
épaules
en
homme
qui
voit
tout
taistoi
donc
murmuratil
hein
faismoi
le
plaisir
de
te
taire
lui
savait
à
quoi
sen
tenir
il
avait
vidé
son
muffat
il
le
sentait
sur
un
signe
de
nana
prêt
à
sallonger
pour
lui
servir
de
tapis
ne
lutte
pas
contre
des
passions
pareilles
aussi
connaissant
les
hommes
ne
songeaitil
plus
qu
à
tirer
le
meilleur
parti
possible
de
la
situation
il
fallait
voir
et
il
attendait
rose
en
scène
cria
bordenave
recommence
le
deux
allons
va
reprit
mignon
laissemoi
faire
puis
goguenard
quand
même
il
trouva
drôle
de
complimenter
fauchery
sur
sa
pièce
très
forte
cette
piècelà
seulement
pourquoi
sa
grande
dame
étaitelle
si
honnête
ce
nétait
pas
nature
et
il
ricanait
en
demandant
qui
avait
posé
pour
le
duc
de
beaurivage
le
ramolli
de
géraldine
fauchery
loin
de
se
fâcher
eut
un
sourire
mais
bordenave
jetant
un
regard
du
côté
de
muffat
parut
contrarié
ce
qui
frappa
mignon
redevenu
grave
commençonsnous
nom
de
dieu
gueulait
le
directeur
allons
donc
barillot
hein
bosc
nest
pas
là
estce
quil
se
fout
de
moi
à
la
fin
pourtant
bosc
arrivait
paisiblement
la
répétition
recommença
au
moment
où
labordette
emmenait
le
comte
celuici
était
tremblant
à
lidée
de
revoir
nana
après
leur
rupture
il
avait
éprouvé
un
grand
vide
il
sétait
laissé
conduire
chez
rose
désoeuvré
croyant
souffrir
du
dérangement
de
ses
habitudes
dailleurs
dans
létourdissement
où
il
vivait
il
voulut
tout
ignorer
se
défendant
de
chercher
nana
fuyant
une
explication
avec
la
comtesse
il
lui
semblait
devoir
cet
oubli
à
sa
dignité
mais
un
sourd
travail
sopérait
et
nana
le
reconquérait
lentement
par
les
souvenirs
par
les
lâchetés
de
sa
chair
par
des
sentiments
nouveaux
exclusifs
attendris
presque
paternels
la
scène
abominable
seffaçait
il
ne
voyait
plus
fontan
il
nentendait
plus
nana
le
jeter
dehors
en
le
souffletant
de
ladultère
de
sa
femme
tout
cela
cétaient
des
mots
qui
senvolaient
tandis
quil
lui
restait
au
coeur
une
étreinte
poignante
dont
la
douceur
le
serrait
toujours
plus
fort
jusqu
à
létouffer
des
naïvetés
lui
venaient
il
saccusait
simaginant
quelle
ne
laurait
pas
trahi
sil
lavait
aimée
réellement
son
angoisse
devint
intolérable
il
fut
très
malheureux
cétait
comme
la
cuisson
dune
blessure
ancienne
non
plus
ce
désir
aveugle
et
immédiat
saccommodant
de
tout
mais
une
passion
jalouse
de
cette
femme
un
besoin
delle
seule
de
ses
cheveux
de
sa
bouche
de
son
corps
qui
le
hantait
lorsquil
se
rappelait
le
son
de
sa
voix
un
frisson
courait
ses
membres
il
la
désirait
avec
des
exigences
davare
et
dinfinies
délicatesses
et
cet
amour
lavait
envahi
si
douloureusement
que
dès
les
premiers
mots
de
labordette
maquignonnant
un
rendezvous
il
sétait
jeté
dans
ses
bras
dun
mouvement
irrésistible
honteux
ensuite
dun
abandon
si
ridicule
chez
un
homme
de
son
rang
mais
labordette
savait
tout
voir
il
donna
encore
une
preuve
de
son
tact
en
quittant
le
comte
devant
lescalier
avec
ces
simples
paroles
coulées
légèrement
au
deuxième
le
corridor
à
droite
la
porte
nest
que
poussée
muffat
était
seul
dans
le
silence
de
ce
coin
de
maison
comme
il
passait
devant
le
foyer
des
artistes
il
avait
aperçu
par
les
portes
ouvertes
le
délabrement
de
la
vaste
pièce
honteuse
de
taches
et
dusure
au
grand
jour
mais
ce
qui
le
surprenait
en
sortant
de
lobscurité
et
du
tumulte
de
la
scène
cétaient
la
clarté
blanche
le
calme
profond
de
cette
cage
descalier
quil
avait
vue
un
soir
enfumée
de
gaz
sonore
dun
galop
de
femmes
lâchées
à
travers
les
étages
sentait
les
loges
désertes
les
corridors
vides
pas
une
âme
pas
un
bruit
tandis
que
par
les
fenêtres
carrées
au
ras
des
marches
le
pâle
soleil
de
novembre
entrait
jetant
des
nappes
jaunes
où
dansaient
des
poussières
dans
la
paix
morte
qui
tombait
den
haut
il
fut
heureux
de
ce
calme
et
de
ce
silence
il
monta
lentement
tâchant
de
reprendre
haleine
son
coeur
battait
à
grands
coups
une
peur
lui
venait
de
se
conduire
comme
un
enfant
avec
des
soupirs
et
des
larmes
alors
sur
le
palier
du
premier
étage
il
sadossa
contre
le
mur
certain
de
nêtre
pas
vu
et
son
mouchoir
aux
lèvres
il
regardait
les
marches
déjetées
la
rampe
de
fer
polie
par
le
frottement
des
mains
le
badigeon
éraflé
toute
cette
misère
de
maison
de
tolérance
étalée
crûment
à
cette
heure
blafarde
de
laprèsmidi
où
les
filles
dorment
pourtant
comme
il
arrivait
au
second
il
dut
enjamber
un
gros
chat
rouge
couché
en
rond
sur
une
marche
les
yeux
à
demi
clos
ce
chat
gardait
seul
la
maison
pris
de
somnolence
dans
les
odeurs
enfermées
et
refroidies
que
les
femmes
laissaient
là
chaque
soir
dans
le
corridor
de
droite
en
effet
la
porte
de
la
loge
se
trouvait
simplement
poussée
nana
attendait
cette
petite
mathilde
un
souillon
dingénue
tenait
sa
loge
très
sale
avec
une
débandade
de
pots
ébréchés
une
toilette
grasse
une
chaise
tachée
de
rouge
comme
si
avait
saigné
sur
la
paille
le
papier
collé
aux
murs
et
au
plafond
était
éclaboussé
jusquen
haut
de
gouttes
deau
savonneuse
cela
sentait
si
mauvais
un
parfum
de
lavande
tourné
à
laigre
que
nana
ouvrit
la
fenêtre
et
elle
resta
accoudée
une
minute
respirant
se
penchant
pour
voir
audessous
madame
bron
dont
elle
entendait
le
balai
sacharner
sur
les
dalles
verdies
de
létroite
cour
enfoncée
dans
lombre
un
serin
accroché
contre
une
persienne
jetait
des
roulades
perçantes
nentendait
point
les
voitures
du
boulevard
ni
des
rues
voisines
il
avait
là
une
paix
de
province
un
large
espace
où
le
soleil
dormait
en
levant
les
yeux
elle
apercevait
les
petits
bâtiments
et
les
vitrages
luisants
des
galeries
du
passage
puis
audelà
en
face
delle
les
hautes
maisons
de
la
rue
vivienne
dont
les
façades
de
derrière
se
dressaient
muettes
et
comme
vides
des
terrasses
sétageaient
un
photographe
avait
perché
sur
un
toit
une
grande
cage
en
verre
bleu
cétait
très
gai
nana
soubliait
lorsquil
lui
sembla
quon
avait
frappé
elle
se
tourna
elle
cria
entrez
en
voyant
le
comte
elle
referma
la
fenêtre
il
ne
faisait
pas
chaud
et
cette
curieuse
de
madame
bron
navait
pas
besoin
dentendre
tous
deux
se
regardèrent
sérieusement
puis
comme
il
demeurait
très
raide
lair
étranglé
elle
se
mit
à
rire
elle
dit
eh
bien
te
voilà
donc
grosse
bête
son
émotion
était
si
forte
quil
semblait
glacé
il
lappela
madame
il
sestimait
heureux
de
la
revoir
alors
pour
brusquer
les
choses
elle
se
montra
plus
familière
encore
ne
la
fais
pas
à
la
dignité
puisque
tu
désiré
voir
hein
ce
nest
pas
pour
nous
regarder
comme
deux
chiens
de
faïence
nous
avons
eu
des
torts
tous
les
deux
oh
moi
je
te
pardonne
et
il
fut
convenu
quon
ne
parlerait
plus
de
ça
lui
approuvait
de
la
tête
il
se
calmait
ne
trouvait
encore
rien
à
dire
dans
le
flot
tumultueux
qui
lui
montait
aux
lèvres
surprise
de
cette
froideur
elle
joua
le
grand
jeu
allons
tu
es
raisonnable
repritelle
avec
un
mince
sourire
maintenant
que
nous
avons
fait
la
paix
donnonsnous
une
poignée
de
main
et
restons
bons
amis
comment
bons
amis
murmuratil
subitement
inquiet
oui
cest
peutêtre
idiot
mais
je
tenais
à
ton
estime
cette
heure
nous
nous
sommes
expliqués
et
au
moins
si
lon
se
rencontre
naura
pas
lair
de
deux
cruches
il
eut
un
geste
pour
linterrompre
laissemoi
finir
pas
un
homme
entendstu
n
une
cochonnerie
à
reprocher
eh
bien
ça
mennuyait
de
commencer
par
toi
chacun
son
honneur
mon
cher
mais
ce
nest
pas
ça
criatil
violemment
assiedstoi
écoutemoi
et
comme
sil
eût
craint
de
la
voir
partir
il
la
poussa
sur
lunique
chaise
lui
marchait
dans
une
agitation
croissante
la
petite
loge
close
et
pleine
de
soleil
avait
une
douceur
tiède
une
paix
moite
que
nul
bruit
du
dehors
ne
troublait
dans
les
moments
de
silence
entendait
seulement
les
roulades
aiguës
du
serin
pareilles
aux
trilles
dune
flûte
lointaine
écoute
ditil
en
se
plantant
devant
elle
je
suis
venu
pour
te
reprendre
oui
je
veux
recommencer
tu
le
sais
bien
pourquoi
parlestu
comme
tu
le
fais
réponds
tu
consens
elle
avait
baissé
la
tête
elle
grattait
de
longle
la
paille
rouge
qui
saignait
sous
elle
et
le
voyant
anxieux
elle
ne
se
pressait
pas
enfin
elle
leva
sa
face
devenue
grave
ses
beaux
yeux
où
elle
avait
réussi
à
mettre
de
la
tristesse
oh
impossible
mon
petit
jamais
je
ne
recollerai
avec
toi
pourquoi
bégayatil
tandis
quune
contraction
dindicible
souffrance
passait
sur
son
visage
pourquoi
dame
parce
que
cest
impossible
voilà
tout
je
ne
veux
pas
il
la
regarda
quelques
secondes
encore
ardemment
puis
les
jambes
coupées
il
sabattit
sur
le
carreau
elle
dun
air
dennui
se
contenta
dajouter
ah
ne
fais
pas
lenfant
mais
il
le
faisait
déjà
tombé
à
ses
pieds
il
lavait
prise
par
la
taille
il
la
serrait
étroitement
la
face
entre
ses
genoux
quil
senfonçait
dans
la
chair
quand
il
la
sentit
ainsi
quand
il
la
retrouva
avec
le
velours
de
ses
membres
sous
létoffe
mince
de
sa
robe
une
convulsion
le
secoua
et
il
grelottait
la
fièvre
éperdu
se
meurtrissant
davantage
contre
ses
jambes
comme
sil
avait
voulu
entrer
en
elle
la
vieille
chaise
craquait
des
sanglots
de
désir
sétouffaient
sous
le
plafond
bas
dans
lair
aigri
par
danciens
parfums
eh
bien
après
disait
nana
en
le
laissant
faire
tout
ça
ne
tavance
à
rien
puisque
ce
nest
pas
possible
mon
dieu
que
tu
es
jeune
il
sapaisa
mais
il
restait
par
terre
il
ne
la
lâchait
pas
disant
dune
voix
entrecoupée
écoute
au
moins
ce
que
je
venais
toffrir
déjà
jai
vu
un
hôtel
près
du
parc
monceau
je
réaliserais
tous
tes
désirs
pour
tavoir
sans
partage
je
donnerais
fortune
oui
ce
serait
lunique
condition
sans
partage
entendstu
et
si
tu
consentais
à
nêtre
qu
à
moi
oh
je
te
voudrais
la
plus
belle
la
plus
riche
voitures
diamants
toilettes
nana
à
chaque
offre
disait
non
de
la
tête
superbement
puis
comme
il
continuait
comme
il
parlait
de
placer
de
largent
sur
elle
ne
sachant
plus
quoi
mettre
à
ses
pieds
elle
parut
perdre
patience
voyons
astu
fini
de
tripoter
je
suis
bonne
fille
je
veux
bien
un
moment
puisque
ça
te
rend
si
malade
mais
en
voilà
assez
nestce
pas
laissemoi
lever
tu
fatigues
elle
se
dégagea
quand
elle
fut
debout
non
non
non
je
ne
veux
pas
alors
il
se
ramassa
péniblement
et
sans
force
il
tomba
sur
la
chaise
accoudé
au
dossier
le
visage
entre
les
mains
nana
marchait
à
son
tour
un
moment
elle
regarda
le
papier
taché
la
toilette
grasse
ce
trou
sale
qui
baignait
dans
un
soleil
pâle
puis
sarrêtant
devant
le
comte
elle
parla
avec
une
carrure
tranquille
cest
drôle
les
hommes
riches
simaginent
quils
peuvent
tout
avoir
pour
leur
argent
eh
bien
et
si
je
ne
veux
pas
je
fiche
de
tes
cadeaux
tu
donnerais
paris
ce
serait
non
toujours
non
voistu
ce
nest
guère
propre
ici
eh
bien
je
trouverais
ça
très
gentil
si
ça
plaisait
vivre
avec
toi
tandis
quon
crève
dans
tes
palais
si
le
coeur
n
est
pas
ah
largent
mon
pauvre
chien
je
lai
quelque
part
voistu
je
danse
dessus
largent
je
crache
dessus
et
elle
prenait
une
mine
de
dégoût
puis
elle
tourna
au
sentiment
elle
ajouta
sur
un
ton
mélancolique
je
sais
quelque
chose
qui
vaut
mieux
que
largent
ah
si
lon
donnait
ce
que
je
désire
il
releva
lentement
la
tête
ses
yeux
eurent
une
lueur
despoir
oh
tu
ne
peux
pas
le
donner
repritelle
ça
ne
dépend
pas
de
toi
et
cest
pour
ça
que
je
ten
parle
enfin
nous
causons
je
voudrais
avoir
le
rôle
de
la
femme
honnête
dans
leur
machine
quelle
femme
honnête
murmuratil
étonné
leur
duchesse
hélène
donc
sils
croient
que
je
vais
jouer
géraldine
plus
souvent
un
rôle
de
rien
du
tout
une
scène
et
encore
dailleurs
ce
nest
pas
ça
jai
assez
des
cocottes
toujours
des
cocottes
dirait
vraiment
que
jai
seulement
des
cocottes
dans
le
ventre
la
fin
cest
vexant
car
je
vois
clair
ils
ont
lair
de
croire
mal
élevée
ah
bien
mon
petit
en
voilà
qui
se
fourrent
le
doigt
dans
loeil
quand
je
veux
être
distinguée
je
suis
dun
chic
tiens
regarde
un
peu
ça
et
elle
recula
jusqu
à
la
fenêtre
puis
revint
en
se
rengorgeant
en
mesurant
ses
enjambées
avec
des
airs
circonspects
de
grosse
poule
hésitant
à
se
salir
les
pattes
lui
la
suivait
les
yeux
encore
pleins
de
larmes
hébété
par
cette
brusque
scène
de
comédie
qui
traversait
sa
douleur
elle
se
promena
un
instant
pour
bien
se
montrer
dans
tout
son
jeu
avec
des
sourires
fins
des
battements
de
paupière
des
balancements
de
jupe
et
plantée
de
nouveau
devant
lui
hein
ça
est
je
crois
oh
tout
à
fait
balbutiatil
étranglé
encore
les
regards
troubles
quand
je
te
dis
que

femme
honnête

n
mon
petit
air
de
duchesse

hommes

lorsque
jai
passé
devant
toi
en
te
lorgnant

airlà
dans
les
veines
et
puis
je
veux
jouer
une
femme
honnête
jen

suis
malheureuse
il
faut
le
rôle
tu
entends
elle
était
devenue
sérieuse
la
voix
dure
très
émue
souffrant
réellement
de
son
bête
de
désir
muffat
toujours
sous
le
coup
de
ses
refus
attendait
sans
comprendre
il
eut
un
silence
pas
un
vol
de
mouche
ne
troublait
la
paix
de
la
maison
vide
tu
ne
sais
pas
repritelle
carrément
tu
vas
faire
donner
le
rôle
il
resta
stupéfait
puis
avec
un
geste
désespéré
mais
cest
impossible
tu
disais
toimême
que
ça
ne
dépendait
pas
de
moi
elle
linterrompit
dun
haussement
dépaules
tu
vas
descendre
et
tu
diras
à
bordenave
que
tu
veux
le
rôle
ne
sois
donc
pas
si
naïf
bordenave
besoin
dargent
eh
bien
tu
lui
en
prêteras
puisque
tu
en
à
jeter
par
les
fenêtres
et
comme
il
se
débattait
encore
elle
se
fâcha
cest
bien
je
comprends
tu
crains
de
fâcher
rose
je
ne
ten
ai
pas
parlé
de
cellelà
lorsque
tu
pleurais
par
terre
jaurais
trop
long
à
en
dire
oui
quand
juré
à
une
femme
de
laimer
toujours
ne
prend
pas
le
lendemain
la
première
venue
oh
la
blessure
est
là
je
souviens
dailleurs
mon
cher
ça
n
rien
de
ragoûtant
le
reste
des
mignon
estce
quavant
de
faire
la
bête
sur
mes
genoux
tu
naurais
pas
dû
rompre
avec
ce
sale
monde
il
se
récriait
il
finit
par
pouvoir
placer
une
phrase
eh
je
moque
de
rose
je
vais
la
lâcher
tout
de
suite
nana
parut
satisfaite
sur
ce
point
elle
reprit
alors
questce
qui
te
gêne
bordenave
est
le
maître
tu
diras
quil
fauchery
après
bordenave
elle
avait
ralenti
la
voix
elle
arrivait
au
point
délicat
de
laffaire
muffat
les
yeux
baissés
se
taisait
il
était
resté
dans
une
ignorance
volontaire
sur
les
assiduités
de
fauchery
auprès
de
la
comtesse
se
tranquillisant
à
la
longue
espérant
sêtre
trompé
pendant
cette
nuit
affreuse
passée
sous
une
porte
de
la
rue
taitbout
mais
il
gardait
contre
lhomme
une
répugnance
une
colère
sourdes
eh
bien
quoi
fauchery
ce
nest
pas
le
diable
répétait
nana
tâtant
le
terrain
voulant
savoir
où
en
étaient
les
choses
entre
le
mari
et
lamant
en
viendra
à
bout
de
fauchery
au
fond
je
tassure
il
est
bon
garçon
hein
cest
entendu
tu
lui
diras
que
cest
pour
moi
lidée
dune
pareille
démarche
révolta
le
comte
non
non
jamais
criatil
elle
attendit
cette
phrase
lui
montait
aux
lèvres
fauchery
n
rien
à
te
refuser
mais
elle
sentit
que
ce
serait
un
peu
raide
comme
argument
seulement
elle
eut
un
sourire
et
ce
sourire
qui
était
drôle
disait
la
phrase
muffat
ayant
levé
les
yeux
sur
elle
les
baissa
de
nouveau
gêné
et
pâle
ah
tu
nes
pas
complaisant
murmuratelle
enfin
je
ne
peux
pas
ditil
plein
dangoisse
tout
ce
que
tu
voudras
mais
pas
ça
mon
amour
oh
je
ten
prie
alors
elle
ne
sattarda
pas
à
discuter
de
ses
petites
mains
elle
lui
renversa
la
tête
puis
se
penchant
colla
sa
bouche
sur
sa
bouche
dans
un
long
baiser
un
frisson
le
secoua
il
tressaillait
sous
elle
éperdu
les
yeux
clos
et
elle
le
mit
debout
va
ditelle
simplement
il
marcha
il
se
dirigea
vers
la
porte
mais
comme
il
sortait
elle
le
reprit
dans
ses
bras
en
se
faisant
humble
et
câline
la
face
levée
frottant
son
menton
de
chatte
sur
son
gilet
où
est
lhôtel
demandatelle
très
bas
de
lair
confus
et
rieur
dune
enfant
qui
revient
à
de
bonnes
choses
dont
elle
n
pas
voulu
avenue
de
villiers
et
il
des
voitures
oui
des
dentelles
des
diamants
oui
oh
que
tu
es
bon
mon
chat
tu
sais
tout
à
lheure
cétait
par
jalousie
et
cette
fois
je
te
jure
ce
ne
sera
pas
comme
la
première
puisque
maintenant
tu
comprends
ce
quil
faut
à
une
femme
tu
donnes
tout
nestce
pas
alors
je
nai
besoin
de
personne
tiens
il
n
en
plus
que
pour
toi
ça
et
ça
et
encore
ça
quand
elle
leut
poussé
dehors
après
lavoir
chauffé
dune
pluie
de
baisers
sur
les
mains
et
sur
la
figure
elle
souffla
un
moment
mon
dieu
quil
avait
donc
une
mauvaise
odeur
dans
la
loge
de
cette
sans
soin
de
mathilde
il
faisait
bon
une
de
ces
tranquilles
chaleurs
des
chambres
de
provence
au
soleil
dhiver
mais
vraiment
ça
sentait
trop
leau
de
lavande
gâtée
avec
dautres
choses
pas
propres
elle
ouvrit
la
fenêtre
elle
accouda
de
nouveau
examinant
les
vitrages
du
passage
pour
tromper
son
attente
dans
lescalier
muffat
descendait
en
chancelant
la
tête
bourdonnante
quallaitil
dire
de
quelle
façon
entameraitil
cette
affaire
qui
ne
le
regardait
pas
il
arrivait
sur
la
scène
lorsquil
entendit
une
querelle
achevait
le
second
acte
prullière
semportait
fauchery
ayant
voulu
couper
une
de
ses
répliques
coupez
tout
alors
criaitil
jaime
mieux
ça
comment
je
nai
pas
deux
cents
lignes
et
men
coupe
encore
non
jen
ai
assez
je
rends
le
rôle
il
sortit
de
sa
poche
un
petit
cahier
froissé
le
tourna
dans
ses
mains
fiévreuses
en
faisant
mine
de
le
jeter
sur
les
genoux
de
cossard
sa
vanité
souffrante
convulsait
sa
face
blême
les
lèvres
amincies
les
yeux
enflammés
sans
quil
pût
cacher
cette
révolution
intérieure
lui
prullière
lidole
du
public
jouer
un
rôle
de
deux
cents
lignes
pourquoi
pas
faire
apporter
des
lettres
sur
un
plateau
repritil
avec
amertume
voyons
prullière
soyez
gentil
dit
bordenave
qui
le
ménageait
à
cause
de
son
action
sur
les
loges
ne
commencez
pas
vos
histoires
vous
trouvera
des
effets
nestce
pas
fauchery
vous
ajouterez
des
effets
au
troisième
acte
pourrait
même
allonger
une
scène
alors
déclara
le
comédien
je
veux
le
mot
du
baisser
du
rideau
doit
bien
ça
fauchery
eut
lair
de
consentir
par
son
silence
et
prullière
remit
le
rôle
dans
sa
poche
secoué
encore
mécontent
quand
même
bosc
et
fontan
durant
lexplication
avaient
pris
une
mine
de
profonde
indifférence
chacun
pour
soi
ça
ne
les
regardait
pas
ils
se
désintéressaient
et
tous
les
acteurs
entourèrent
fauchery
le
questionnant
quêtant
des
éloges
pendant
que
mignon
écoutait
les
dernières
plaintes
de
prullière
sans
perdre
de
vue
le
comte
muffat
dont
il
avait
guetté
le
retour
le
comte
dans
cette
obscurité
où
il
rentrait
sétait
arrêté
au
fond
de
la
scène
hésitant
à
tomber
dans
la
querelle
mais
bordenave
laperçut
et
se
précipita
hein
quel
monde
murmuratil
vous
ne
vous
imaginez
pas
monsieur
le
comte
le
mal
que
jai
avec
ce
mondelà
tous
plus
vaniteux
les
uns
que
les
autres
et
carotteurs
avec
ça
mauvais
comme
la
gale
toujours
dans
de
sales
histoires
ravis
si
je
cassais
les
reins
pardon
je
memporte
il
se
tut
un
silence
régna
muffat
cherchait
une
transition
mais
il
ne
trouva
rien
il
finit
par
dire
carrément
pour
en
sortir
plus
vite
nana
veut
le
rôle
de
la
duchesse
bordenave
eut
un
soubresaut
en
criant
allons
donc
cest
fou
puis
comme
il
regardait
le
comte
il
le
trouva
si
pâle
si
bouleversé
quil
se
calma
aussitôt
diable
ditil
simplement
et
le
silence
recommença
au
fond
lui
sen
moquait
ce
serait
peutêtre
drôle
cette
grosse
nana
dans
le
rôle
de
la
duchesse
dailleurs
avec
cette
histoire
il
tenait
muffat
solidement
aussi
sa
décision
futelle
bientôt
prise
il
se
tourna
et
appela
fauchery
le
comte
avait
eu
un
geste
pour
larrêter
fauchery
nentendait
pas
poussé
contre
le
manteau
darlequin
par
fontan
il
devait
subir
des
explications
sur
la
façon
dont
le
comédien
comprenait
tardiveau
fontan
voyait
tardiveau
en
marseillais
avec
de
laccent
et
il
imitait
laccent
des
répliques
entières
passaient
étaitce
bien
ainsi
il
ne
semblait
que
soumettre
des
idées
dont
il
doutait
luimême
mais
fauchery
se
montrant
froid
et
faisant
des
objections
il
se
vexa
tout
de
suite
très
bien
du
moment
où
lesprit
du
rôle
lui
échappait
il
vaudrait
mieux
pour
tout
le
monde
quil
ne
le
jouât
pas
fauchery
cria
de
nouveau
bordenave
alors
le
jeune
homme
se
sauva
heureux
déchapper
à
lacteur
qui
demeura
blessé
dune
retraite
si
prompte
ne
restons
pas
là
reprit
bordenave
venez
messieurs
pour
se
garer
des
oreilles
curieuses
il
les
mena
dans
le
magasin
des
accessoires
derrière
la
scène
mignon
surpris
les
regarda
disparaître
descendait
quelques
marches
cétait
une
pièce
carrée
dont
les
deux
fenêtres
donnaient
sur
la
cour
un
jour
de
cave
entrait
par
les
vitres
sales
blafard
sous
le
plafond
bas
là
dans
des
casiers
qui
encombraient
la
pièce
traînait
un
bricàbrac
dobjets
de
toutes
sortes
le
déballage
dun
revendeur
de
la
rue
de
lappe
qui
liquide
un
pêlemêle
sans
nom
dassiettes
de
coupes
en
carton
doré
de
vieux
parapluies
rouges
de
cruches
italiennes
de
pendules
de
tous
les
styles
de
plateaux
et
dencriers
darmes
à
feu
et
de
seringues
le
tout
sous
une
couche
de
poussière
dun
pouce
méconnaissable
ébréché
cassé
entassé
et
une
insupportable
odeur
de
ferraille
de
chiffons
de
cartonnages
humides
montait
de
ces
tas
où
les
débris
des
pièces
jouées
samoncelaient
depuis
cinquante
ans
entrez
répétait
bordenave
nous
serons
seuls
au
moins
le
comte
très
gêné
fit
quelques
pas
pour
laisser
le
directeur
risquer
seul
la
proposition
fauchery
sétonnait
quoi
donc
demandatil
voilà
dit
enfin
bordenave
une
idée
nous
est
venue
surtout
ne
sautez
pas
cest
très
sérieux
questce
que
vous
pensez
de
nana
dans
le
rôle
de
la
duchesse
lauteur
resta
effaré
puis
il
éclata
ah
non
nestce
pas
cest
une
plaisanterie
rirait
trop
eh
bien
ce
nest
déjà
pas
si
mauvais
quand
rit
réfléchissez
mon
cher
lidée
plaît
beaucoup
à
monsieur
le
comte
muffat
par
contenance
venait
de
prendre
sur
une
planche
dans
la
poussière
un
objet
quil
ne
semblait
pas
reconnaître
cétait
un
coquetier
dont
avait
refait
le
pied
en
plâtre
il
le
garda
sans
en
avoir
conscience
et
savança
pour
murmurer
oui
oui
ce
serait
très
bien
fauchery
se
tourna
vers
lui
avec
un
geste
de
brusque
impatience
le
comte
navait
rien
à
voir
dans
sa
pièce
et
il
dit
nettement
jamais
nana
en
cocotte
tant
quon
voudra
mais
en
femme
du
monde
non
par
exemple
vous
vous
trompez
je
vous
assure
reprit
muffat
qui
senhardissait
justement
elle
vient
de
faire
la
femme
honnête
où
donc
demanda
fauchery
dont
la
surprise
augmentait
làhaut
dans
une
loge
eh
bien
cétait
ça
oh
une
distinction
elle
surtout
un
coup
doeil
vous
savez
en
passant
dans
ce
genre
et
son
coquetier
à
la
main
il
voulut
imiter
nana
soubliant
dans
un
besoin
passionné
de
convaincre
ces
messieurs
fauchery
le
regardait
stupéfait
il
avait
compris
il
ne
se
fâchait
plus
le
comte
qui
sentit
son
regard
où
il
avait
de
la
moquerie
et
de
la
pitié
sarrêta
pris
dune
faible
rougeur
mon
dieu
cest
possible
murmura
lauteur
par
complaisance
elle
serait
peutêtre
très
bien
seulement
le
rôle
est
donné
nous
ne
pouvons
le
reprendre
à
rose
oh
sil
n
que
ça
dit
bordenave
je
charge
darranger
laffaire
mais
alors
les
voyant
tous
les
deux
contre
lui
comprenant
que
bordenave
avait
un
intérêt
caché
le
jeune
homme
pour
ne
pas
faiblir
se
révolta
avec
un
redoublement
de
violence
de
façon
à
rompre
lentretien
eh
non
eh
non
quand
même
le
rôle
serait
libre
jamais
je
ne
le
lui
donnerais
là
estce
clair
laissezmoi
tranquille
je
nai
pas
envie
de
tuer
pièce
il
se
fit
un
silence
embarrassé
bordenave
jugeant
quil
était
de
trop
séloigna
le
comte
restait
la
tête
basse
il
la
releva
avec
effort
il
dit
dune
voix
qui
saltérait
mon
cher
si
je
vous
demandais
cela
comme
un
service
je
ne
puis
pas
je
ne
puis
pas
répétait
fauchery
en
se
débattant
la
voix
de
muffat
devint
plus
dure
je
vous
en
prie
je
le
veux
et
il
le
regardait
fixement
devant
ce
regard
noir
où
il
lut
une
menace
le
jeune
homme
céda
tout
dun
coup
balbutiant
des
paroles
confuses
faites
après
tout
je
men
moque
ah
vous
abusez
vous
verrez
vous
verrez
lembarras
fut
alors
plus
grand
fauchery
sétait
adossé
à
un
casier
tapant
nerveusement
du
pied
muffat
paraissait
examiner
avec
attention
le
coquetier
quil
tournait
toujours
cest
un
coquetier
vint
dire
bordenave
obligeamment
tiens
oui
cest
un
coquetier
répéta
le
comte
excusez
vous
vous
êtes
empli
de
poussière
continua
le
directeur
en
replaçant
lobjet
sur
une
planche
vous
comprenez
sil
fallait
épousseter
tous
les
jours
nen
finirait
plus
aussi
nestce
guère
propre
hein
quel
fouillis
eh
bien
vous
croirez
si
vous
voulez
il
en
encore
pour
de
largent
regardez
regardez
tout
ça
il
promena
muffat
devant
les
casiers
dans
le
jour
verdâtre
qui
venait
de
la
cour
lui
nommant
des
ustensiles
voulant
lintéresser
à
son
inventaire
de
chiffonnier
comme
il
disait
en
riant
puis
dun
ton
léger
quand
ils
furent
revenus
près
de
fauchery
écoutez
puisque
nous
sommes
tous
daccord
nous
allons
terminer
cette
affaire
justement
voilà
mignon
depuis
un
instant
mignon
rôdait
dans
le
couloir
aux
premiers
mots
de
bordenave
parlant
de
modifier
leur
traité
il
semporta
cétait
une
infamie
voulait
briser
lavenir
de
sa
femme
il
plaiderait
cependant
bordenave
très
calme
donnait
des
raisons
le
rôle
ne
lui
semblait
pas
digne
de
rose
il
préférait
la
garder
pour
une
opérette
qui
passerait
après
la
petite
duchesse
mais
comme
le
mari
criait
toujours
il
offrit
brusquement
de
résilier
parlant
des
offres
faites
à
la
chanteuse
par
les
foliesdramatiques
alors
mignon
un
moment
démonté
sans
nier
ces
offres
afficha
un
grand
dédain
de
largent
avait
engagé
sa
femme
pour
jouer
la
duchesse
hélène
elle
la
jouerait
quand
il
devrait
lui
mignon
perdre
sa
fortune
cétait
affaire
de
dignité
dhonneur
engagée
sur
ce
terrain
la
discussion
fut
interminable
le
directeur
en
revenait
toujours
à
ce
raisonnement
puisque
les
folies
offraient
trois
cents
francs
par
soirée
à
rose
pendant
cent
représentations
lorsquelle
en
touchait
seulement
cent
cinquante
chez
lui
cétait
quinze
mille
francs
de
gain
pour
elle
du
moment
où
il
la
laissait
partir
le
mari
ne
lâchait
pas
non
plus
le
terrain
de
lart
que
diraiton
si
lon
voyait
enlever
le
rôle
à
sa
femme
quelle
nétait
pas
suffisante
quon
avait
dû
la
remplacer
de
là
un
tort
considérable
une
diminution
pour
lartiste
non
non
jamais
la
gloire
avant
la
richesse
et
tout
dun
coup
il
indiqua
une
transaction
rose
par
son
traité
avait
à
payer
un
dédit
de
dix
mille
francs
si
elle
se
retirait
eh
bien
quon
lui
donnât
dix
mille
francs
et
elle
irait
aux
foliesdramatiques
bordenave
resta
étourdi
pendant
que
mignon
qui
navait
pas
quitté
le
comte
des
yeux
attendait
tranquillement
alors
tout
sarrange
murmura
muffat
soulagé
peut
sentendre
ah
non
par
exemple
ce
serait
trop
bête
cria
bordenave
emporté
par
ses
instincts
dhomme
daffaires
dix
mille
francs
pour
lâcher
rose
se
ficherait
de
moi
mais
le
comte
lui
ordonnait
daccepter
en
multipliant
les
signes
de
tête
il
hésita
encore
enfin
grognant
regrettant
les
dix
mille
francs
bien
quils
ne
dussent
pas
sortir
de
sa
poche
il
reprit
avec
brutalité
après
tout
je
veux
bien
au
moins
je
serai
débarrassé
de
vous
depuis
un
quart
dheure
fontan
écoutait
dans
la
cour
très
intrigué
il
était
descendu
se
poster
à
cette
place
quand
il
eut
compris
il
remonta
et
se
donna
le
régal
davertir
rose
ah
bien
en
faisait
un
potin
sur
son
compte
elle
était
rasée
rose
courut
au
magasin
des
accessoires
tous
se
turent
elle
regarda
les
quatre
hommes
muffat
baissa
la
tête
fauchery
répondit
par
un
haussement
dépaules
désespéré
au

elle
tremblait
très
pâle
ses
petits

serrés
un
moment
elle
le
dévisagea
dans
une
révolte
de
tout
son
être
elle
qui
dhabitude
sabandonnait
docilement
pour
les
questions
daffaires
lui
laissant
la
signature
des
traités
avec
ses
directeurs
et
ses
amants
et
elle
ne
trouva
que
ce
cri
dont
elle
lui
cingla
la
face
comme
dun
coup
de
fouet
ah
tiens
tu
es
trop
lâche
puis
elle
se
sauva
mignon
stupéfait
courut
derrière
elle
quoi
donc
elle
devenait
folle
il
lui
expliquait
à

mais
rose
ne
répondait
pas
enragée
alors
mignon
dédaigneux
la
laissa
à
son
dépit
de
femme
il
dit
à
bordenave
qui
revenait
sur
la

avec
fauchery
et
muffat

justement
nana
prévenue
par
labordette
descendait
triomphante

faisait
la

honnête
avec
des
airs
de

pour
épater
son

et
prouver
à
ces

faillit
se
compromettre

jetée
sur

étranglée
balbutiant

je
te

il

nana
soubliant
devant
cette
brusque
attaque
allait
se
mettre
les

aux

et
la
traiter
de

elle
se
retint
elle
exagéra
le

flûté
de

avec
un
geste
de
marquise
qui
va
marcher
sur
une

ditelle
vous

chère
puis
elle
continua
ses
grâces
pendant
que
rose
partait
suivie
de

qui
ne
la
reconnaissait

venait
dobtenir
de

sans

à

vint
le
saisir
par

tout

en
demandant
sil
la
trouvait
si
atroce
elle
ne
la
lui
mangerait
pas
sa

et
elle
le
fit
rire
elle
laissa
entendre
quil
serait
bête
de
se
fâcher
avec
elle
dans
sa
position
chez
les
muffat
si
elle
manquait
de
mémoire
elle
prendrait
du
souffleur
ferait
la

dailleurs
il
se
trompait
sur
son
compte
il
verrait
comme
elle
brûlerait
les
planches
alors
convint
que
lauteur
remanierait
un
peu
le
rôle
de
la

pour
donner
davantage
à

fut
ravi
dans
cette
joie
que

apportait
naturellement
avec

froid
planté
au

du

jaune
de

il
sétalait
découpant
larête
vive
de
son

de
bouc
affectant
une
pose
abandonnée
et
nana
tranquillement
sapprocha
lui
donna
une
poignée
de

oui
pas
mal
et
toi
très
bien
merci
ce
fut
tout
ils
semblaient
sêtre
quittés
la
veille
à
la
porte
du

cependant
les
acteurs
attendaient
mais
bordenave
dit
quon
ne

pas
le

le

quil
réconfortait
un
mois
plus
tard
la

de

fut
pour

un
grand
désastre
elle
montra
atrocement

elle
eut
des
prétentions
à

cétait
une

aussi
lorsque

le
soir
se
retrouva
seule
avec

allongée
dans

souriait
dun

gai
sous

de

frisures
blondes

noyaient
le
bleu
cerné
de

était
ainsi
tombée
sur
un

dun

très
fin
dans

des

mais
comme
latelier
qui
occupait
le
centre
de
la
maison
ne
pouvait
lui
servir
elle
avait
bouleversé
les
étages
laissant
au
rezdechaussée
une
serre
un
grand
salon
et
la
salle
à

établissant
au
premier
un
petit
salon
près
de

de

étonnait

en
fille
du

de

ayant
dinstinct
toutes

élégances
enfin
elle
ne
gâta
pas
trop
lhôtel
elle
ajouta
même
aux
richesses
du
mobilier
sauf
quelques
traces
de
bêtise
tendre
et
de
splendeur
criarde
où
lon
retrouvait

rêvé
devant

et
cétait
dès

une
odeur
de
violette

tiède
enfermé
dans
dépaisses

un
vitrail
aux

dune
pâleur

étouffaient

dévot

dont
le
silence
derrière

quand

recevait

dhabitude
elle
descendait
simplement
aux

perdue

déjeunait
seule
dans

à

avec
une

au

avait
refait
la

la

en

la

en
application
de

sur

bleue
et
elle
nétait

satisfaite

pour

incrustée
de

dargent
partout
des
peaux

blancs
traînaient
si
nombreuses
quelles
couvraient
le

raffinement
de

navait
pu

déshabituer
de
sasseoir
à

pour
ôter

des

au

tandis
que
des
fauteuils
larges
comme
des

et
des
canapés
profonds
comme
des
alcôves
mettaient
là
une
paresse
molle
une
vie
somnolente
de
sérail
la
pièce
gardait
le
ton
du
vieil
fondu
de
vert
et
de
rouge
sans
que
rien
marquât
trop
la
fille
en
dehors
de
la
volupté
des

seules
deux
statuettes
de

une
femme
en
chemise
cherchant
ses
puces
et
une
autre
absolument
nue
marchant
sur
les
mains
les

en

suffisaient
à
salir
le

dune
tache
de
bêtise
originelle
et
par
une
porte
presque
toujours
ouverte
apercevait
le
cabinet
de

tout
en
marbre
et
en

avec
la

de

et

et

un
rideau
fermé
faisait
un
petit
jour
blanc
qui
semblait
dormir
comme
chauffé
dun
parfum
de
violette
ce
parfum
troublant
de
nana
dont
lhôtel
entier
jusqu
à
la
cour
était
pénétré
la
grosse
affaire
fut
de
monter
la
maison
nana
avait
bien
zoé
cette
fille
dévouée
à
sa
fortune
qui
depuis
des
mois
attendait
tranquillement
ce
brusque
lançage
certaine
de
son
flair
maintenant
zoé
triomphait
maîtresse
de
lhôtel
faisant
sa
pelote
tout
en
servant
madame
le
plus
honnêtement
possible
mais
une
femme
de
chambre
ne
suffisait
plus
il
fallait
un
maître
dhôtel
un
cocher
un
concierge
une
cuisinière
dautre
part
il
sagissait
dinstaller
les
écuries
alors
labordette
se
rendit
fort
utile
en
se
chargeant
des
courses
qui
ennuyaient
le
comte
il
maquignonna
lachat
des
chevaux
il
courut
les
carrossiers
guida
les
choix
de
la
jeune
femme
quon
rencontrait
à
son
bras
chez
les
fournisseurs
même
labordette
amena
les
domestiques
charles
un
grand
gaillard
de
cocher
qui
sortait
de
chez
le
duc
de
corbreuse
julien
un
petit
maître
dhôtel
tout
frisé
lair
souriant
et
un
ménage
dont
la
femme
victorine
était
cuisinière
et
dont
lhomme
françois
fut
pris
comme
concierge
et
valet
de
pied
ce
dernier
en
culotte
courte
poudré
portant
la
livrée
de
nana
bleu
clair
et
galon
dargent
recevait
les
visiteurs
dans
le
vestibule
cétait
dune
tenue
et
dune
correction
princières
dès
le
second
mois
la
maison
fut
montée
le
train
dépassait
trois
cent
mille
francs
il
avait
huit
chevaux
dans
les
écuries
et
cinq
voitures
dans
les
remises
dont
un
landau
garni
dargent
qui
occupa
un
instant
tout
paris
et
nana
au
milieu
de
cette
fortune
se
casait
faisait
son
trou
elle
avait
quitté
le
théâtre
dès
la
troisième
représentation
de
la
petite
duchesse
laissant
bordenave
se
débattre
sous
une
menace
de
faillite
malgré
largent
du
comte
pourtant
elle
gardait
une
amertume
de
son
insuccès
cela
sajoutait
à
la
leçon
de
fontan
une
saleté
dont
elle
rendait
tous
les
hommes
responsables
aussi
maintenant
se
disaitelle
très
forte
à
lépreuve
des
toquades
mais
les
idées
de
vengeance
ne
tenaient
guère
avec
sa
cervelle
doiseau
ce
qui
demeurait
en
dehors
des
heures
de
colère
était
chez
elle
un
appétit
de
dépense
toujours
éveillé
un
dédain
naturel
de
lhomme
qui
payait
un
continuel
caprice
de
mangeuse
et
de
gâcheuse
fière
de
la
ruine
de
ses
amants
dabord
nana
mit
le
comte
sur
un
bon
pied
elle
établit
nettement
le
programme
de
leurs
relations
lui
donnait
douze
mille
francs
par
mois
sans
compter
les
cadeaux
et
ne
demandait
en
retour
quune
fidélité
absolue
elle
jura
la
fidélité
mais
elle
exigea
des
égards
une
liberté
entière
de
maîtresse
de
maison
un
respect
complet
de
ses
volontés
ainsi
elle
recevrait
tous
les
jours
ses
amis
il
viendrait
seulement
à
des
heures
réglées
enfin
sur
toutes
choses
il
aurait
une
foi
aveugle
en
elle
et
quand
il
hésitait
pris
dune
inquiétude
jalouse
elle
faisait
de
la
dignité
en
menaçant
de
lui
tout
rendre
ou
bien
elle
jurait
sur
la
tête
du
petit
louis
ça
devait
suffire
il
n
avait
pas
damour
où
il
n
avait
pas
destime
au
bout
du
premier
mois
muffat
la
respectait
mais
elle
voulut
et
elle
obtint
davantage
bientôt
elle
prit
sur
lui
une
influence
de
bonne
fille
quand
il
arrivait
maussade
elle
légayait
puis
le
conseillait
après
lavoir
confessé
peu
à
peu
elle
soccupa
des
ennuis
de
son
intérieur
de
sa
femme
de
sa
fille
de
ses
affaires
de
coeur
et
dargent
très
raisonnable
pleine
de
justice
et
dhonnêteté
une
seule
fois
elle
se
laissa
emporter
par
la
passion
le
jour
où
il
lui
confia
que
daguenet
allait
sans
doute
demander
en
mariage
sa
fille
estelle
depuis
que
le
comte
saffichait
daguenet
avait
cru
habile
de
rompre
de
la
traiter
en
coquine
jurant
darracher
son
futur
beaupère
des
griffes
de
cette
créature
aussi
habillatelle
dune
jolie
manière
son
ancien
mimi
cétait
un
coureur
qui
avait
mangé
sa
fortune
avec
de
vilaines
femmes
il
manquait
de
sens
moral
il
ne
se
faisait
pas
donner
dargent
mais
il
profitait
de
largent
des
autres
en
payant
seulement
de
loin
en
loin
un
bouquet
ou
un
dîner
et
comme
le
comte
semblait
excuser
ces
faiblesses
elle
lui
apprit
crûment
que
daguenet
lavait
eue
elle
donna
des
détails
dégoûtants
muffat
était
devenu
très
pâle
il
ne
fut
plus
question
du
jeune
homme
ça
lui
apprendrait
à
manquer
de
reconnaissance
cependant
lhôtel
nétait
pas
entièrement
meublé
que
nana
un
soir
où
elle
avait
prodigué
à
muffat
les
serments
de
fidélité
les
plus
énergiques
retint
le
comte
xavier
de
vandeuvres
qui
depuis
quinze
jours
lui
faisait
une
cour
assidue
de
visites
et
de
fleurs
elle
céda
non
par
toquade
plutôt
pour
se

lorsque
vandeuvres
le
lendemain
laida
à
payer
une
note
dont
elle
ne
voulait
pas
parler
à
lautre
elle
lui
tirerait
bien
huit
à
dix
mille
francs
par
mois
ce
serait
là
de
largent
de
poche
très
utile
il
achevait
alors
sa
fortune
dans
un
coup
de
fièvre
chaude
ses
chevaux
et
lucy
lui
avaient
mangé
trois
fermes
nana
allait
dune
bouchée
avaler
son
dernier
château
près
damiens
et
il
avait
comme
une
hâte
de
tout
balayer
jusquaux
décombres
de
la
vieille
tour
bâtie
par
un
vandeuvres
sous
philippe
auguste
enragé
dun
appétit
de
ruines
trouvant
beau
de
laisser
les
derniers
besants
dor
de
son
blason
aux
mains
de
cette
fille
que
paris
désirait
lui
aussi
accepta
les
conditions
de
nana
une
liberté
entière
des
tendresses
à
jours
fixes
sans
même
avoir
la
naïveté
passionnée
dexiger
des
serments
muffat
ne
se
doutait
de
rien
quant
à
vandeuvres
il
savait
à
coup
sûr
mais
jamais
il
ne
faisait
la
moindre
allusion
il
affectait
dignorer
avec
son
fin
sourire
de
viveur
sceptique
qui
ne
demande
pas
limpossible
pourvu
quil
ait
son
heure
et
que
paris
le
sache
dès
lors
nana
eut
réellement
sa
maison
montée
le
personnel
était
complet
à
lécurie
à
loffice
et
dans
la
chambre
de
madame
zoé
organisait
tout
sortait
des
complications
les
plus
imprévues
cétait
machiné
comme
un
théâtre
réglé
comme
une
grande
administration
et
cela
fonctionnait
avec
une
précision
telle
que
pendant
les
premiers
mois
il
n
eut
pas
de
heurts
ni
de
détraquements
seulement
madame
donnait
trop
de
mal
à
zoé
par
des
imprudences
des
coups
de
tête
des
bravades
folles
aussi
la
femme
de
chambre
se
relâchaitelle
peu
à
peu
ayant
remarqué
dailleurs
quelle
tirait
de
plus
gros
profits
des
heures
de
gâchis
quand
madame
avait
fait
une
bêtise
quil
fallait
réparer
alors
les
cadeaux
pleuvaient
elle
pêchait
des
louis
dans
leau
trouble
un
matin
comme
muffat
nétait
pas
encore
sorti
de
la
chambre
zoé
introduisit
un
monsieur
tout
tremblant
dans
le
cabinet
de
toilette
où
nana
changeait
de
linge
tiens
zizi
dit
la
jeune
femme
stupéfaite
cétait
georges
en
effet
mais
en
la
voyant
en
chemise
avec
ses
cheveux
dor
sur
ses
épaules
nues
il
sétait
jeté
à
son
cou
lavait
prise
et
la
baisait
partout
elle
se
débattait
effrayée
étouffant
sa
voix
balbutiant
finis
donc
il
est
là
cest
stupide
et
vous
zoé
êtesvous
folle
emmenezle
gardezle
en
bas
je
vais
tâcher
de
descendre
zoé
dut
le
pousser
devant
elle
en
bas
dans
la
salle
à
manger
lorsque
nana
put
les
rejoindre
elle
les
gronda
tous
les
deux
zoé
pinçait
les
lèvres
et
elle
se
retira
lair
vexé
en
disant
quelle
avait
pensé
faire
plaisir
à
madame
georges
regardait
nana
avec
un
tel
bonheur
de
la
revoir
que
ses
beaux
yeux
semplissaient
de
larmes
maintenant
les
mauvais
jours
étaient
passés
sa
mère
le
croyait
raisonnable
et
lui
avait
permis
de
quitter
les
fondettes
aussi
en
débarquant
à
la
gare
venaitil
de
prendre
une
voiture
pour
embrasser
plus
vite
sa
bonne
chérie
il
parlait
de
vivre
désormais
près
delle
comme
làbas
quand
il
lattendait
pieds
nus
dans
la
chambre
de
la
mignotte
et
tout
en
contant
son
histoire
il
avançait
les
doigts
par
un
besoin
de
la
toucher
après
cette
cruelle
année
de
séparation
il
semparait
de
ses
mains
fouillait
dans
les
larges
manches
du
peignoir
remontait
jusquaux
épaules
tu
aimes
toujours
ton
bébé
demandatil
de
sa
voix
denfant
bien
sûr
que
je
laime
répondit
nana
qui
se
dégagea
dun
mouvement
brusque
mais
tu
tombes
sans
crier
gare
tu
sais
mon
petit
je
ne
suis
pas
libre
il
faut
être
sage
georges
descendu
de
voiture
dans
léblouissement
dun
long
désir
enfin
contenté
navait
pas
même
vu
les
lieux
où
il
entrait
alors
il
eut
conscience
dun
changement
autour
de
lui
il
examina
la
riche
salle
à
manger
avec
son
haut
plafond
décoré
ses
gobelins
son
dressoir
éblouissant
dargenterie
ah
oui
ditil
tristement
et
elle
lui
fit
entendre
quil
ne
devait
jamais
venir
le
matin
laprèsmidi
sil
voulait
de
quatre
à
six
cétait
lheure
où
elle
recevait
puis
comme
il
la
regardait
dun
air
suppliant
dinterrogation
sans
rien
demander
elle
le
baisa
à
son
tour
sur
le
front
en
se
montrant
très
bonne
sois
bien
sage
je
ferai
mon
possible
murmuratelle
mais
la
vérité
était
que
ça
ne
lui
disait
plus
rien
elle
trouvait
georges
très
gentil
elle
aurait
voulu
lavoir
pour
camarade
pas
davantage
cependant
quand
il
arrivait
tous
les
jours
à
quatre
heures
il
semblait
si
malheureux
quelle
cédait
souvent
encore
le
gardait
dans
ses
armoires
lui
laissait
continuellement
ramasser
les
miettes
de
sa
beauté
il
ne
quittait
plus
lhôtel
familier
comme
le
petit
chien
bijou
lun
et
lautre
dans
les
jupes
de
maîtresse
ayant
un
peu
delle
même
lorsquelle
était
avec
un
autre
attrapant
des
aubaines
de
sucre
et
de
caresses
aux
heures
dennui
solitaire
sans
doute
madame
hugon
apprit
la
rechute
du
petit
entre
les
bras
de
cette
mauvaise
femme
car
elle
accourut
à
paris
elle
vint
réclamer
laide
de
son
autre
fils
le
lieutenant
philippe
alors
en
garnison
à
vincennes
georges
qui
se
cachait
de
son
frère
aîné
fut
pris
de
désespoir
craignant
quelque
coup
de
force
et
comme
il
ne
pouvait
rien
garder
dans
lexpansion
nerveuse
de
sa
tendresse
il
nentretint
bientôt
plus
nana
que
de
son
grand
frère
un
gaillard
solide
qui
oserait
tout
tu
comprends
expliquaitil
maman
ne
viendra
pas
chez
toi
tandis
quelle
peut
envoyer
mon
frère
bien
sûr
elle
va
envoyer
philippe
chercher
la
première
fois
nana
fut
très
blessée
elle
dit
sèchement
je
voudrais
voir
ça
par
exemple
il
beau
être
lieutenant
françois
te
le
flanquera
à
la
porte
et
raide
puis
le
petit
revenant
toujours
sur
son
frère
elle
finit
par
soccuper
de
philippe
au
bout
dune
semaine
elle
le
connut
des
pieds
à
la
tête
très
grand
très
fort
gai
un
peu
brutal
et
avec
ça
des
détails
intimes
des
poils
sur
les
bras
un
signe
à
lépaule
si
bien
quun
jour
toute
pleine
de
limage
de
cet
homme
quelle
devait
faire
jeter
à
la
porte
elle
sécria
dis
donc
zizi
il
ne
vient
pas
ton
frère
cest
donc
un
lâcheur
le
lendemain
comme
georges
se
trouvait
seul
avec
nana
françois
monta
pour
demander
si
madame
recevrait
le
lieutenant
philippe
hugon
il
devint
tout
pâle
il
murmura
je
men
doutais
maman
parlé
ce
matin
et
il
suppliait
la
jeune
femme
de
faire
répondre
quelle
ne
pouvait
recevoir
mais
elle
se
levait
déjà
tout
enflammée
en
disant
pourquoi
donc
il
croirait
que
jai
peur
ah
bien
nous
allons
rire
françois
laissez
ce
monsieur
un
quart
dheure
dans
le
salon
ensuite
vous
lamènerez
elle
ne
se
rassit
pas
elle
marchait
fiévreuse
allant
de
la
glace
de
la
cheminée
à
un
miroir
de
venise
pendu
audessus
dun
coffret
italien
et
chaque
fois
elle
donnait
un
coup
doeil
essayait
un
sourire
tandis
que
georges
sans
force
sur
un
canapé
tremblait
à
lidée
de
la
scène
qui
se
préparait
tout
en
se
promenant
elle
lâchait
des
phrases
courtes
ça
le
calmera
ce
garçon
dattendre
un
quart
dheure
et
puis
sil
croit
venir
chez
une
fille
le
salon
va
lépater
oui
oui
regarde
bien
tout
mon
bonhomme
ce
nest
pas
du
toc
ça
tapprendra
à
respecter
la
bourgeoise
il
n
encore
que
le
respect
pour
les
hommes
hein
le
quart
dheure
est
écoulé
non
à
peine
dix
minutes
oh
nous
avons
le
temps
elle
ne
tenait
pas
en
place
au
quart
elle
renvoya
georges
en
lui
faisant
jurer
de
ne
pas
écouter
à
la
porte
car
ce
serait
inconvenant
si
les
domestiques
le
voyaient
comme
il
passait
dans
la
chambre
zizi
risqua
dune
voix
étranglée
tu
sais
cest
mon
frère
naie
pas
peur
ditelle
avec
dignité
sil
est
poli
je
serai
polie
françois
introduisait
philippe
hugon
qui
était
en
redingote
dabord
georges
traversa
la
chambre
sur
la
pointe
des
pieds
pour
obéir
à
la
jeune
femme
mais
les
voix
le
retinrent
hésitant
si
plein
dangoisse
que
ses
jambes
mollissaient
il
simaginait
des
catastrophes
des
gifles
quelque
chose
dabominable
qui
le
fâcherait
pour
toujours
avec
nana
aussi
ne
putil
résister
au
besoin
de
revenir
coller
son
oreille
contre
la
porte
il
entendait
très
mal
lépaisseur
des
portières
étouffait
les
bruits
pourtant
il
attrapait
quelques
mots
prononcés
par
philippe
des
phrases
dures
où
sonnaient
les
mots
denfant
de
famille
dhonneur
dans
lanxiété
de
ce
que
sa
chérie
allait
répondre
son
coeur
battait
létourdissait
dun
bourdonnement
confus
coup
sûr
elle
lâcherait
un
sale
mufe
ou
un
foutezmoi
la
paix
je
suis
chez
moi
et
rien
ne
venait
pas
un
souffle
nana
était
comme
morte
làdedans
bientôt
même
la
voix
de
son
frère
sadoucit
il
ne
comprenait
plus
lorsquun
murmure
étrange
acheva
de
le
stupéfier
cétait
nana
qui
sanglotait
pendant
un
instant
il
fut
en
proie
à
des
sentiments
contraires
se
sauver
tomber
sur
philippe
mais
juste
à
cette
minute
zoé
entra
dans
la
chambre
et
il
séloigna
de
la
porte
honteux
dêtre
surpris
tranquillement
elle
rangeait
du
linge
dans
une
armoire
tandis
que
muet
immobile
il
appuyait
le
front
contre
une
vitre
dévoré
dincertitude
elle
demanda
au
bout
dun
silence
cest
votre
frère
qui
est
chez
madame
oui
répondit
lenfant
dune
voix
étranglée
il
eut
un
nouveau
silence
et
ça
vous
inquiète
nestce
pas
monsieur
georges
oui
répétatil
avec
la
même
difficulté
souffrante
zoé
ne
se
pressait
pas
elle
plia
des
dentelles
elle
dit
lentement
vous
avez
tort
madame
va
arranger
ça
et
ce
fut
tout
ils
ne
parlèrent
plus
mais
elle
ne
quittait
pas
la
chambre
un
grand
quart
dheure
encore
elle
tourna
sans
voir
monter
lexaspération
de
lenfant
qui
blêmissait
de
contrainte
et
de
doute
il
jetait
des
coups
doeil
obliques
sur
le
salon
que
pouvaientils
faire
pendant
si
longtemps
peutêtre
nana
pleuraitelle
toujours
lautre
brutal
devait
lui
avoir
fichu
des
calottes
aussi
lorsque
zoé
sen
alla
enfin
courutil
à
la
porte
collant
de
nouveau
son
oreille
et
il
resta
effaré
la
tête
décidément
perdue
car
il
entendait
une
brusque
envolée
de
gaieté
des
voix
tendres
qui
chuchotaient
des
rires
étouffés
de
femme
quon
chatouille
dailleurs
presque
aussitôt
nana
reconduisit
philippe
jusqu
à
lescalier
avec
un
échange
de
paroles
cordiales
et
familières
quand
georges
osa
rentrer
dans
le
salon
la
jeune
femme
debout
devant
la
glace
se
regardait
eh
bien
demandatil
ahuri
eh
bien
quoi
ditelle
sans
se
retourner
puis
négligemment
que
disaistu
donc
il
est
très
gentil
ton
frère
alors
cest
arrangé
bien
sûr
cest
arrangé
ah
ça
que
te
prendil
croirait
que
nous
allions
nous
battre
georges
ne
comprenait
toujours
pas
il
balbutia
il
mavait
semblé
entendre
tu
nas
pas
pleuré
pleuré
moi
criatelle
en
le
regardant
fixement
tu
rêves
pourquoi
veuxtu
que
jaie
pleuré
et
ce
fut
lenfant
qui
se
troubla
quand
elle
lui
fit
une
scène
pour
avoir
désobéi
et
sêtre
arrêté
derrière
la
porte
à
moucharder
comme
elle
le
boudait
il
revint
avec
une
soumission
câline
voulant
savoir
alors
mon
frère
ton
frère
vu
tout
de
suite
où
il
était
tu
comprends
jaurais
pu
être
une
fille
et
dans
ce
cas
son
intervention
sexpliquait
à
cause
de
ton
âge
et
de
lhonneur
de
ta
famille
oh
moi
je
comprends
ces
sentiments
mais
un
coup
doeil
lui
suffi
il
sest
conduit
en
homme
du
monde
ainsi
ne
tinquiète
plus
tout
est
fini
il
va
tranquilliser
ta
maman
et
elle
continua
avec
un
rire
dailleurs
tu
verras
ton
frère
ici
je
lai
invité
il
reviendra
ah
il
reviendra
dit
le
petit
en
pâlissant
il
najouta
rien
ne
causa
plus
de
philippe
elle
shabillait
pour
sortir
et
il
la
regardait
de
ses
grands
yeux
tristes
sans
doute
il
était
bien
content
que
les
choses
se
fussent
arrangées
car
il
aurait
préféré
la
mort
à
une
rupture
mais
au
fond
de
lui
il
avait
une
angoisse
sourde
une
douleur
profonde
quil
ne
connaissait
pas
et
dont
il
nosait
parler
jamais
il
ne
sut
de
quelle
façon
philippe
rassura
leur
mère
trois
jours
plus
tard
elle
retournait
aux
fondettes
lair
satisfait
le
soir
même
chez
nana
il
tressaillit
lorsque
françois
annonça
le
lieutenant
celuici
gaiement
plaisanta
le
traita
en
galopin
dont
il
avait
favorisé
une
escapade
qui
ne
tirait
pas
à
conséquence
lui
restait
le
coeur
serré
nosant
plus
bouger
ayant
des
rougeurs
de
fille
aux
moindres
mots
il
avait
peu
vécu
dans
la
camaraderie
de
philippe
son
aîné
de
dix
ans
il
le
redoutait
à
légal
dun
père
auquel
cache
les
histoires
de
femme
aussi
éprouvaitil
une
honte
pleine
de
malaise
en
le
voyant
si
libre
près
de
nana
riant
très
haut
lâché
dans
le
plaisir
avec
sa
belle
santé
cependant
comme
son
frère
se
présenta
bientôt
tous
les
jours
georges
finit
par
saccoutumer
un
peu
nana
rayonnait
cétait
un
dernier
emménagement
en
plein
gâchis
de
la
vie
galante
une
crémaillère
pendue
insolemment
dans
un
hôtel
qui
crevait
dhommes
et
de
meubles
une
aprèsmidi
que
les
fils
hugon
se
trouvaient
là
le
comte
muffat
vint
en
dehors
des
heures
réglées
mais
zoé
lui
ayant
répondu
que
madame
était
avec
des
amis
il
se
retira
sans
vouloir
entrer
affectant
une
discrétion
de
galant
homme
lorsquil
reparut
le
soir
nana
laccueillit
avec
la
froide
colère
dune
femme
outragée
monsieur
ditelle
je
ne
vous
ai
donné
aucune
raison
de
minsulter
entendezvous
quand
je
serai
chez
moi
je
vous
prie
dentrer
comme
tout
le
monde
le
comte
restait
béant
mais
chère
tâchatil
dexpliquer
parce
que
javais
des
visites
peutêtre
oui
il
avait
des
hommes
que
croyezvous
donc
que
je
fasse
avec
ces
hommes
affiche
une
femme
en
prenant
de
ces
airs
damant
discret
et
je
ne
veux
pas
être
affichée
moi
il
obtint
difficilement
son
pardon
au
fond
il
était
ravi
cétait
par
des
scènes
pareilles
quelle
le
tenait
souple
et
convaincu
depuis
longtemps
elle
lui
avait
imposé
georges
un
gamin
qui
lamusait
disaitelle
elle
le
fit
dîner
avec
philippe
et
le
comte
se
montra
très
aimable
au
sortir
de
table
il
prit
le
jeune
homme
à
part
il
lui
demanda
des
nouvelles
de
sa
mère
dès
lors
les
fils
hugon
vandeuvres
et
muffat
furent
ouvertement
de
la
maison
où
ils
se
serraient
la
main
en
intimes
cétait
plus
commode
seul
muffat
mettait
encore
de
la
discrétion
à
venir
trop
souvent
gardant
le
ton
de
cérémonie
dun
étranger
en
visite
la
nuit
quand
nana
assise
à
terre
sur
ses
peaux
dours
retirait
ses
bas
il
parlait
amicalement
de
ces
messieurs
de
philippe
surtout
qui
était
la
loyauté
même
ça
cest
bien
vrai
ils
sont
gentils
disait
nana
restée
par
terre
à
changer
de
chemise
seulement
tu
sais
ils
voient
qui
je
suis
un
mot
et
je
te
les
flanquerais
à
la
porte
cependant
dans
son
luxe
au
milieu
de
cette
cour
nana
sennuyait
à
crever
elle
avait
des
hommes
pour
toutes
les
minutes
de
la
nuit
et
de
largent
jusque
dans
les
tiroirs
de
sa
toilette
mêlé
aux
peignes
et
aux
brosses
mais
ça
ne
la
contentait
plus
elle
sentait
comme
un
vide
quelque
part
un
trou
qui
la
faisait
bâiller
sa
vie
se
traînait
inoccupée
ramenant
les
mêmes
heures
monotones
le
lendemain
nexistait
pas
elle
vivait
en
oiseau

cette
certitude
quon
la
nourrirait
la
laissait
allongée
la
journée
entière
sans
un
effort
endormie
au
fond
de
cette
oisiveté
et
de
cette
soumission
de
couvent
comme
enfermée
dans
son
métier
de
fille
ne
sortant
quen
voiture
elle
perdait
lusage
de
ses
jambes
elle
retournait
à
des
goûts
de
gamine
baisait
bijou
du
matin
au
soir
tuait
le
temps
à
des
plaisirs
bêtes
dans
son
unique
attente
de
lhomme
quelle
subissait
dun
air
de
lassitude
complaisante
et
au
milieu
de
cet
abandon
dellemême
elle
ne
gardait
guère
que
le
souci
de
sa
beauté
un
soin
continuel
de
se
visiter
de
se
laver
de
se
parfumer
partout
avec
lorgueil
de
pouvoir
se
mettre
nue
à
chaque
instant
et
devant
nimporte
qui
sans
avoir
à
rougir
le
matin
nana
se
levait
à
dix
heures
bijou
le
griffon
écossais
la
réveillait
en
lui
léchant
la
figure
et
cétait
alors
un
joujou
de
cinq
minutes
des
courses
du
chien
à
travers
ses
bras
et
ses
cuisses
qui
blessaient
le
comte
muffat
bijou
fut
le
premier
petit
homme
dont
il
eût
de
la
jalousie
ce
nétait
pas
convenable
quune
bête
mît
de
la
sorte
le
nez
sous
les
couvertures
puis
nana
passait
dans
son
cabinet
de
toilette
où
elle
prenait
un
bain
vers
onze
heures
francis
venait
lui
relever
les
cheveux
en
attendant
la
coiffure
compliquée
de
laprèsmidi
au
déjeuner
comme
elle
détestait
de
manger
seule
elle
avait
presque
toujours
madame
maloir
qui
arrivait
le
matin
de
linconnu
avec
ses
chapeaux
extravagants
et
retournait
le
soir
dans
ce
mystère
de
sa
vie
dont
personne
dailleurs
ne
sinquiétait
mais
le
moment
le
plus
dur
cétaient
les
deux
ou
trois
heures
entre
le
déjeuner
et
la
toilette
dordinaire
elle
proposait
un
bézigue
à
sa
vieille
amie
parfois
elle
lisait
le
figaro
où
les
échos
des
théâtres
et
les
nouvelles
du
monde
lintéressaient
même
il
lui
arrivait
douvrir
un
livre
car
elle
se
piquait
de
littérature
sa
toilette
la
tenait
jusqu
à
près
de
cinq
heures
alors
seulement
elle
séveillait
de
sa
longue
somnolence
sortant
en
voiture
ou
recevant
chez
elle
toute
une
cohue
dhommes
dînant
souvent
en
ville
se
couchant
très
tard
pour
se
relever
le
lendemain
avec
la
même
fatigue
et
recommencer
des
journées
toujours
semblables
sa
grosse
distraction
était
daller
aux
batignolles
voir
son
petit
louis
chez
sa
tante
pendant
des
quinze
jours
elle
loubliait
puis
cétaient
des
rages
elle
accourait
à
pied
pleine
dune
modestie
et
dune
tendresse
de
bonne
mère
apportant
des
cadeaux
dhôpital
du
tabac
pour
la
tante
des
oranges
et
des
biscuits
pour
lenfant
ou
bien
elle
arrivait
dans
son
landau
au
retour
du
bois
avec
des
toilettes
dont
le
tapage
ameutait
la
rue
solitaire
depuis
que
sa
nièce
était
dans
les
grandeurs
madame
lerat
ne
dégonflait
pas
de
vanité
elle
se
présentait
rarement
avenue
de
villiers
affectant
de
dire
que
ce
nétait
pas
sa
place
mais
elle
triomphait
dans
sa
rue
heureuse
lorsque
la
jeune
femme
venait
avec
des
robes
de
quatre
ou
cinq
mille
francs
occupée
tout
le
lendemain
à
montrer
ses
cadeaux
et
à
citer
des
chiffres
qui
stupéfiaient
les
voisines
le
plus
souvent
nana
réservait
ses
dimanches
pour
la
famille
et
ces
jourslà
si
muffat
linvitait
elle
refusait
avec
le
sourire
dune
petite
bourgeoise
pas
possible
elle
dînait
chez
sa
tante
elle
allait
voir
bébé
avec
ça
ce
pauvre
petit
homme
de
louiset
était
toujours
malade
il
marchait
sur
ses
trois
ans
ça
faisait
un
gaillard
mais
il
avait
eu
un
eczéma
sur
la
nuque
et
maintenant
des
dépôts
se
formaient
dans
ses
oreilles
ce
qui
faisait
craindre
une
carie
des
os
du
crâne
quand
elle
le
voyait
si
pâle
le
sang
gâté
avec
sa
chair
molle
tachée
de
jaune
elle
devenait
sérieuse
et
il
avait
surtout
chez
elle
de
létonnement
que
pouvaitil
avoir
cet
amour
pour
sabîmer
ainsi
elle
sa
mère
se
portait
si
bien
les
jours
où
son
enfant
ne
loccupait
pas
nana
retombait
dans
la
monotonie
bruyante
de
son
existence
promenades
au
bois
premières
représentations
dîners
et
soupers
à
la
maison
dor
ou
au
café
anglais
puis
tous
les
lieux
publics
tous
les
spectacles
où
la
foule
se
ruait
mabille
les
revues
les
courses
et
elle
gardait
quand
même
ce
trou
doisiveté
bête
qui
lui
donnait
comme
des
crampes
destomac
malgré
les
continuelles
toquades
quelle
avait
au
coeur
elle
sétirait
les
bras
dès
quelle
était
seule
dans
un
geste
de
fatigue
immense
la
solitude
lattristait
tout
de
suite
car
elle
retrouvait
avec
le
vide
et
lennui
dellemême
très
gaie
par
métier
et
par
nature
elle
devenait
alors
lugubre
résumant
sa
vie
dans
ce
cri
qui
revenait
sans
cesse
entre
deux
bâillements
oh
que
les
hommes
membêtent
une
aprèsmidi
comme
elle
rentrait
dun
concert
nana
remarqua
sur
un
trottoir
de
la
rue
montmartre
une
femme
qui
trottait
les
bottines
éculées
les
jupes
sales
avec
un
chapeau
détrempé
par
les
pluies
tout
dun
coup
elle
la
reconnut
arrêtez
charles
criatelle
au
cocher
et
appelant
satin
satin
les
passants
tournèrent
la
tête
la
rue
entière
regarda
satin
sétait
approchée
et
se
salissait
encore
aux
roues
de
la
voiture
monte
donc
fille
dit
nana
tranquille
se
moquant
du
monde
et
elle
la
ramassa
elle
lemmena
dégoûtante
dans
son
landau
bleu
clair
à
côté
de
sa
robe
de
soie
gris
perle
garnie
de
chantilly
tandis
que
la
rue
souriait
de
la
haute
dignité
du
cocher
dès
lors
nana
eut
une
passion
qui
loccupa
satin
fut
son
vice
installée
dans
lhôtel
de
lavenue
de
villiers
débarbouillée
nippée
pendant
trois
jours
elle
raconta
saintlazare
et
les
embêtements
avec
les
soeurs
et
ces
salauds
de
la
police
qui
lavaient
mise
en
carte
nana
sindignait
la
consolait
jurait
de
la
tirer
de
là
quand
elle
devrait
ellemême
aller
trouver
le
ministre
en
attendant
rien
ne
pressait
ne
viendrait
pas
la
chercher
chez
elle
bien
sûr
et
des
aprèsmidi
de
tendresse
commencèrent
entre
les
deux
femmes
des
mots
caressants
des
baisers
coupés
de
rires
cétait
le
petit
jeu
interrompu
par
larrivée
des
agents
rue
de
laval
qui
reprenait
sur
un
ton
de
plaisanterie
puis
un
beau
soir
ça
devint
sérieux
nana
si
dégoûtée
chez
laure
comprenait
maintenant
elle
en
fut
bouleversée
enragée
dautant
plus
que
justement
le
matin
du
quatrième
jour
satin
disparut
personne
ne
lavait
vue
sortir
elle
avait
filé
avec
sa
robe
neuve
prise
dun
besoin
dair
ayant
la
nostalgie
de
son
trottoir
ce
jourlà
il
eut
une
tempête
si
rude
dans
lhôtel
que
tous
les
domestiques
baissaient
le
nez
sans
souffler
mot
nana
avait
failli
battre
françois
qui
ne
sétait
pas
mis
en
travers
de
la
porte
elle
tâchait
pourtant
de
se
contenir
elle
traitait
satin
de
sale
grue
ça
lui
apprendrait
à
ramasser
de
pareilles
ordures
dans
le
ruisseau
laprèsmidi
comme
madame
senfermait
zoé
lentendit
sangloter
brusquement
le
soir
elle
demanda
sa
voiture
et
se
fit
conduire
chez
laure
lidée
lui
était
venue
quelle
trouverait
satin
à
la
table
dhôte
de
la
rue
des
martyrs
ce
nétait
pas
pour
la
ravoir
cétait
pour
lui
coller
la
main
sur
la
figure
en
effet
satin
dînait
à
une
petite
table
avec
madame
robert
en
apercevant
nana
elle
se
mit
à
rire
celleci
frappée
au
coeur
ne
fit
pas
de
scène
très
douce
et
très
souple
au
contraire
elle
paya
du
champagne
grisa
cinq
ou
six
tables
puis
enleva
satin
comme
madame
robert
était
aux
cabinets
dans
la
voiture
seulement
elle
la
mordit
elle
la
menaça
une
autre
fois
de
la
tuer
alors
continuellement
le
même
tour
recommença
vingt
reprises
tragique
dans
ses
fureurs
de
femme
trompée
nana
courut
à
la
poursuite
de
cette
gueuse
qui
senvolait
par
toquade
ennuyée
du
bienêtre
de
lhôtel
elle
parlait
de
souffleter
madame
robert
un
jour
même
elle
rêva
de
duel
il
en
avait
une
de
trop
maintenant
quand
elle
dînait
chez
laure
elle
mettait
ses
diamants
emmenant
parfois
louise
violaine
maria
blond
tatan
néné
toutes
resplendissantes
et
dans
le
graillon
des
trois
salles
sous
le
gaz
jaunissant
ces
dames
encanaillaient
leur
luxe
heureuses
dépater
les
petites
filles
du
quartier
quelles
levaient
au
sortir
de
table
ces
jourslà
laure
sanglée
et
luisante
baisait
tout
son
monde
dun
air
de
maternité
plus
large
satin
pourtant
au
milieu
de
ces
histoires
gardait
son
calme
avec
ses
yeux
bleus
et
son
pur
visage
de
vierge
mordue
battue
tiraillée
entre
les
deux
femmes
elle
disait
simplement
que
cétait
drôle
quelles
auraient
bien
mieux
fait
de
sentendre
ça
navançait
à
rien
de
la
gifler
elle
ne
pouvait
se
couper
en
deux
malgré
sa
bonne
volonté
dêtre
gentille
pour
tout
le
monde
la
fin
ce
fut
nana
qui
lemporta
tellement
elle
combla
satin
de
tendresses
et
de
cadeaux
et
pour
se
venger
madame
robert
écrivit
aux
amants
de
sa
rivale
des
lettres
anonymes
abominables
depuis
quelque
temps
le
comte
muffat
paraissait
soucieux
un
matin
très
ému
il
mit
sous
les
yeux
de
nana
une
lettre
anonyme
où
celleci
dès
les
premières
lignes
lut
quon
laccusait
de
tromper
le
comte
avec
vandeuvres
et
les
fils
hugon
cest
faux
cest
faux
criatelle
énergiquement
dun
accent
de
franchise
extraordinaire
tu
le
jures
demanda
muffat
déjà
soulagé
oh
sur
ce
que
tu
voudras
tiens
sur
la
tête
de
mon
enfant
mais
la
lettre
était
longue
ensuite
ses
rapports
avec
satin
trouvaient
racontés
en
termes
dune
crudité
ignoble
quand
elle
eut
fini
elle
eut
un
sourire
maintenant
je
sais
doù
ça
vient
ditelle
simplement
et
comme
muffat
voulait
un
démenti
elle
reprit
avec
tranquillité
ça
mon
loup
cest
une
chose
qui
ne
te
regarde
pas
questce
que
ça
peut
te
faire
elle
ne
niait
point
il
eut
des
paroles
révoltées
alors
elle
haussa
les
épaules
doù
sortaitil
ça
se
faisait
partout
et
elle
nomma
ses
amies
elle
jura
que
les
dames
du
monde
en
étaient
enfin
à
lentendre
il
n
avait
rien
de
plus
commun
ni
de
plus
naturel
ce
qui
nétait
pas
vrai
nétait
pas
vrai
ainsi
tout
à
lheure
il
avait
vu
comme
elle
sindignait
au
sujet
de
vandeuvres
et
des
fils
hugon
ah
pour
ça
il
aurait
eu
raison
de
létrangler
mais
à
quoi
bon
lui
mentir
sur
une
chose
sans
conséquence
et
elle
répétait
sa
phrase
questce
que
ça
peut
te
faire
voyons
puis
la
scène
continuant
elle
coupa
court
dune
voix
rude
dailleurs
mon
cher
si
ça
ne
te
convient
pas
cest
bien
simple
les
portes
sont
ouvertes
voilà
il
faut
prendre
comme
je
suis
il
baissa
la
tête
au
fond
il
restait
heureux
des
serments
de
la
jeune
femme
elle
voyant
sa
puissance
commença
à
ne
plus
le
ménager
et
dès
lors
satin
fut
installée
dans
la
maison
ouvertement
sur
le
même
pied
que
ces
messieurs
vandeuvres
navait
pas
eu
besoin
des
lettres
anonymes
pour
comprendre
il
plaisantait
il
cherchait
des
querelles
de
jalousie
à
satin
tandis
que
philippe
et
georges
la
traitaient
en
camarade
avec
des
poignées
de
main
et
des
plaisanteries
très
raides
nana
eut
une
aventure
un
soir
que
lâchée
par
cette
gueuse
elle
était
allée
dîner
rue
des
martyrs
sans
pouvoir
mettre
la
main
sur
elle
comme
elle
mangeait
seule
daguenet
avait
paru
bien
quil
se
fût
rangé
il
venait
parfois
repris
dun
besoin
de
vice
espérant
nêtre
pas
rencontré
dans
ces
coins
noirs
des
ordures
de
paris
aussi
la
présence
de
nana
semblatelle
le
gêner
dabord
mais
il
nétait
pas
homme
à
battre
en
retraite
il
savança
avec
un
sourire
il
demanda
si
madame
voulait
bien
lui
permettre
de
dîner
à
sa
table
en
le
voyant
plaisanter
nana
prit
son
grand
air
froid
et
répondit
sèchement
placezvous
où
il
vous
plaira
monsieur
nous
sommes
dans
un
lieu
public
commencée
sur
ce
ton
la
conversation
fut
drôle
mais
au
dessert
nana
ennuyée
brûlant
de
triompher
mit
les
coudes
sur
la
table
puis
reprenant
le
tutoiement
eh
bien
et
ton
mariage
mon
petit
ça
marche
pas
fort
avoua
daguenet
en
effet
au
moment
de
risquer
sa
demande
chez
les
muffat
il
avait
senti
une
telle
froideur
de
la
part
du
comte
quil
sétait
prudemment
abstenu
ça
lui
semblait
une
affaire
manquée
nana
le
regardait
fixement
de
ses
yeux
clairs
le
menton
dans
la
main
un
pli
ironique
aux
lèvres
ah
je
suis
une
coquine
repritelle
avec
lenteur
ah
il
faudra
arracher
le
futur
beaupère
de
mes
griffes
eh
bien
vrai
pour
un
garçon
intelligent
tu
es
joliment
bête
comment
tu
vas
faire
des
cancans
à
un
homme
qui
madore
et
qui
répète
tout
écoute
tu
te
marieras
si
je
veux
mon
petit
depuis
un
instant
il
le
sentait
bien
tout
un
projet
de
soumission
poussait
en
lui
cependant
il
plaisantait
toujours
ne
voulant
pas
laisser
tomber
laffaire
dans
le
sérieux
et
après
avoir
mis
ses
gants
il
lui
demanda
avec
les
formes
strictes
la
main
de
mademoiselle
estelle
de
beuville
elle
finit
par
rire
comme
chatouillée
oh
ce
mimi
il
n
avait
pas
moyen
de
lui
garder
rancune
les
grands
succès
de
daguenet
auprès
de
ces
dames
étaient
dus
à
la
douceur
de
sa
voix
une
voix
dune
pureté
et
dune
souplesse
musicales
qui
lavait
fait
surnommer
chez
les
filles
bouchedevelours
toutes
cédaient
dans
la
caresse
sonore
dont
il
les
enveloppait
il
connaissait
cette
force
il
lendormit
dun
bercement
sans
fin
de
paroles
lui
contant
des
histoires
imbéciles
quand
ils
quittèrent
la
table
dhôte
elle
était
toute
rose
vibrante
à
son
bras
reconquise
comme
il
faisait
très
beau
elle
renvoya
sa
voiture
laccompagna
à
pied
jusque
chez
lui
puis
monta
naturellement
deux
heures
plus
tard
elle
dit
en
se
rhabillant
alors
mimi
tu
tiens
à
ce
mariage
dame
murmuratil
cest
encore
ce
que
je
ferais
de
mieux
tu
sais
que
je
nai
plus
le
sac
elle
lappela
pour
boutonner
ses
bottines
et
au
bout
dun
silence
mon
dieu
moi
je
veux
bien
je
te
pistonnerai
elle
est
sèche
comme
un
échalas
cette
petite
mais
puisque
ça
fait
votre
affaire
à
tous
oh
je
suis
complaisante
je
vais
te
bâcler
ça
puis
se
mettant
à
rire
la
gorge
nue
encore
seulement
questce
que
tu
donnes
il
lavait
saisie
il
lui
baisait
les
épaules
dans
un
élan
de
reconnaissance
elle
très
gaie
frémissante
se
débattait
se
renversait
ah
je
sais
criatelle
excitée
par
ce
jeu
écoute
ce
que
je
veux
pour
commission
le
jour
de
ton
mariage
tu
mapporteras
létrenne
de
ton
innocence
avant
ta
femme
entendstu
cest
ça
cest
ça
ditil
riant
plus
fort
quelle
ce
marché
les
amusa
ils
trouvaient
lhistoire
bien
bonne
justement
le
lendemain
il
avait
un
dîner
chez
nana
dailleurs
le
dîner
habituel
du
jeudi
muffat
vandeuvres
les
fils
hugon
et
satin
le
comte
arriva
de
bonne
heure
il
avait
besoin
de
quatrevingt
mille
francs
pour
débarrasser
la
jeune
femme
de
deux
ou
trois
créances
et
lui
donner
une
parure
de
saphirs
dont
elle
mourait
denvie
comme
il
venait
déjà
dentamer
fortement
sa
fortune
il
cherchait
un
prêteur
nosant
encore
vendre
une
propriété
sur
les
conseils
de
nana
ellemême
il
sétait
donc
adressé
à
labordette
mais
celuici

laffaire
trop
lourde

voulu
en
parler
au
coiffeur
francis
qui
volontiers
soccupait
dobliger
ses
clientes
le
comte
se
mettait
entre
les
mains
de
ces
messieurs
par
un

prenaient
lengagement
de

en

le
billet
de

quil
signerait
et
ils
sexcusaient
de
ces
vingt
mille

ils
criaient
contre
les
gredins
dusuriers
où
ils
avaient
dû
frapper
disaientils
lorsque
muffat
se
fit
annoncer
francis
achevait
de
coiffer
nana
labordette
se
trouvait
aussi
dans
le
cabinet
avec
sa
familiarité
dami
sans
conséquence
en
voyant
le
comte
il
posa
discrètement
un
fort
paquet
de
billets
de
banque
parmi
les
poudres
et
les
pommades
et
le
billet
fut
signé
sur
le
marbre
de
la
toilette
nana
voulait
retenir
labordette
à
dîner
il
refusa
il
promenait
un
riche
étranger
dans
paris
cependant
muffat
layant
pris
à
part
pour
le
supplier
de
courir
chez
becker
le
joaillier
et
de
lui
rapporter
la
parure
de
saphirs
dont
il
voulait
faire
le
soir
même
une
surprise
à
la
jeune
femme
labordette
se
chargea
volontiers
de
la
commission
une
demiheure
plus
tard
julien
remettait
lécrin
au
comte
mystérieusement
pendant
le
dîner
nana
fut
nerveuse
la
vue
des
quatrevingt
mille
francs
lavait
agitée
dire
que
toute
cette
monnaie
allait
passer
à
des
fournisseurs
ça
la
dégoûtait
dès
le
potage
dans
cette
salle
à
manger
superbe
éclairée
du
reflet
de
largenterie
et
des
cristaux
elle
tourna
au
sentiment
elle
célébra
les
bonheurs
de
la
pauvreté
les
hommes
étaient
en
habit
ellemême
portait
une
robe
de
satin
blanc
brodé
tandis
que
satin
plus
modeste
en
soie
noire
avait
simplement
au
cou
un
coeur
dor
un
cadeau
de
sa
bonne
amie
et
derrière
les
convives
julien
et
françois
servaient
aidés
de
zoé
tous
les
trois
très
dignes
bien
sûr
que
je
mamusais
davantage
quand
je
navais
pas
le
sou
répétait
nana
elle
avait
placé
muffat
à
sa
droite
et
vandeuvres
à
sa
gauche
mais
elle
ne
les
regardait
guère
occupée
de
satin
qui
trônait
en
face
delle
entre
philippe
et
georges
nestce
pas
mon
chat
disaitelle
à
chaque
phrase
avonsnous
ri
à
cette
époque
lorsque
nous
allions
à
la
pension
de
la
mère
josse
rue
polonceau
servait
le
rôti
les
deux
femmes
se
lancèrent
dans
leurs
souvenirs
ça
les
prenait
par
crises
bavardes
elles
avaient
un
brusque
besoin
de
remuer
cette
boue
de
leur
jeunesse
et
cétait
toujours
quand
il
avait
là
des
hommes
comme
si
elles
cédaient
à
une
rage
de
leur
imposer
le
fumier
où
elles
avaient
grandi
ces
messieurs
pâlissaient
avec
des
regards
gênés
les
fils
hugon
tâchaient
de
rire
pendant
que
vandeuvres
frisait
nerveusement
sa
barbe
et
que
muffat
redoublait
de
gravité
tu
te
souviens
de
victor
dit
nana
en
voilà
un
enfant
vicieux
qui
menait
les
petites
filles
dans
les
caves
parfaitement
répondit
satin
je
rappelle
très
bien
la
grande
cour
chez
toi
il
avait
une
concierge
avec
un
balai
la
mère
boche
elle
est
morte
et
je
vois
encore
votre
boutique
ta
mère
était
une
grosse
un
soir
que
nous
jouions
ton
père
est
rentré
pochard
mais
pochard
ce
moment
vandeuvres
tenta
une
diversion
en
se
jetant
à
travers
les
souvenirs
de
ces
dames
dites
donc
chère
je
reprendrais
volontiers
des
truffes
elles
sont
exquises
jen
ai
mangé
hier
chez
le
duc
de
corbreuse
qui
ne
les
valaient
pas
julien
les
truffes
dit
rudement
nana
puis
revenant
ah
dame
papa
nétait
guère
raisonnable
aussi
quelle
dégringolade
si
tu
avais
vu
ça
un
plongeon
une
dèche
je
peux
dire
que
jen
ai
supporté
de
toutes
les
couleurs
et
cest
miracle
si
je
n
ai
pas
laissé
peau
comme
papa
et
maman
cette
fois
muffat
qui
jouait
avec
un
couteau
énervé
se
permit
dintervenir
ce
nest
pas
gai
ce
que
vous
racontez
là
hein
quoi
pas
gai
criatelle
en
le
foudroyant
dun
regard
je
crois
bien
que
ce
nest
pas
gai
il
fallait
nous
apporter
du
pain
mon
cher
oh
moi
vous
savez
je
suis
une
bonne
fille
je
dis
les
choses
comme
elles
sont
maman
était
blanchisseuse
papa
se
soûlait
et
il
en
est
mort
voilà
si
ça
ne
vous
convient
pas
si
vous
avez
honte
de
famille
tous
protestèrent
quallaitelle
chercher
là
respectait
sa
famille
mais
elle
continuait
si
vous
avez
honte
de
famille
eh
bien
laissezmoi
parce
que
je
ne
suis
pas
une
de
ces
femmes
qui
renient
leur
père
et
leur
mère
il
faut
prendre
avec
eux
entendezvous
ils
la
prenaient
ils
acceptaient
le
papa
la
maman
le
passé
ce
quelle
voudrait
les
yeux
sur
la
table
tous
quatre
maintenant
se
faisaient
petits
tandis
quelle
les
tenait
sous
ses
anciennes
savates
boueuses
de
la
rue
de
la
gouttedor
avec
lemportement
de
sa
toutepuissance
et
elle
ne
désarma
pas
encore
aurait
beau
lui
apporter
des
fortunes
lui
bâtir
des
palais
elle
regretterait
toujours
lépoque
où
elle
croquait
des
pommes
une
blague
cet
idiot
dargent
cétait
fait
pour
les
fournisseurs
puis
son
accès
se
termina
dans
un
désir
sentimental
dune
vie
simple
le
coeur
sur
la
main
au
milieu
dune
bonté
universelle
mais
à
ce
moment
elle
aperçut
julien
les
bras
ballants
qui
attendait
eh
bien
quoi
servez
le
champagne
ditelle
quavezvous
à
regarder
comme
une
oie
pendant
la
scène
les
domestiques
navaient
pas
eu
un
sourire
ils
semblaient
ne
pas
entendre
plus
majestueux
à
mesure
que
madame
se
lâchait
davantage
julien
sans
broncher
se
mit
à
verser
le
champagne
par
malheur
françois
qui
présentait
les
fruits
pencha
trop
le
compotier
et
les
pommes
les
poires
le
raisin
roulèrent
sur
la
table
fichu
maladroit
cria
nana
le
valet
eut
le
tort
de
vouloir
expliquer
que
les
fruits
nétaient
pas
montés
solidement
zoé
les
avait
ébranlés
en
prenant
des
oranges
alors
dit
nana
cest
zoé
qui
est
une
dinde
mais
madame
murmura
la
femme
de
chambre
blessée
du
coup
madame
se
leva
et
la
voix
brève
avec
un
geste
de
royale
autorité
assez
nestce
pas
sortez
tous
nous
navons
plus
besoin
de
vous
cette
exécution
la
calma
elle
se
montra
tout
de
suite
très
douce
très
aimable
le
dessert
fut
charmant
ces
messieurs
ségayaient
à
se
servir
euxmêmes
mais
satin
qui
avait
pelé
une
poire
était
venue
la
manger
derrière
sa
chérie
appuyée
à
ses
épaules
lui
disant
dans
le
cou
des
choses
dont
elles
riaient
très
fort
puis
elle
voulut
partager
son
dernier
morceau
de
poire
elle
le
lui
présenta
entre
les
dents
et
toutes
deux
se
mordillaient
les
lèvres
achevaient
le
fruit
dans
un
baiser
alors
ce
fut
une
protestation
comique
de
la
part
de
ces
messieurs
philippe
leur
cria
de
ne
pas
se
gêner
vandeuvres
demanda
sil
fallait
sortir
georges
était
venu
prendre
satin
par
la
taille
et
lavait
ramenée
à
sa
place

et
tournée
vers

de
son
air
sérieux
nestce

mon
ami
oui
certainement
murmuratil
en
approuvant
dun
lent
signe
de
tête
il
navait
plus
une
protestation
au
milieu
de
ces
messieurs
de
ces
grands
noms
de
ces
vieilles
honnêtetés
les
deux
femmes
face
à
face
échangeant
un
regard
tendre
simposaient
et
régnaient
avec
le
tranquille
abus
de
leur
sexe
et
leur
mépris
avoué
de
lhomme
ils
applaudirent
monta
prendre
le
café
dans
le
petit
salon
deux
lampes
éclairaient
dune
lueur
molle
les
tentures
roses
les
bibelots
aux
tons
de
laque
et
de
vieil
cétait
à
cette
heure
de
nuit
au
milieu
des
coffres
des
bronzes
des
faïences
un
jeu
de
lumière
discret
allumant
une
incrustation
dargent
ou
divoire
détachant
le
luisant
dune
baguette
sculptée
moirant
un
panneau
dun
reflet
de
soie
le
feu
de
laprèsmidi
se
mourait
en
braise
il
faisait
très
chaud
une
chaleur
alanguie
sous
les
rideaux
et
les
portières
et
dans
cette
pièce
toute
pleine
de
la
vie
intime
de
nana
où
traînaient
ses
gants
un
mouchoir
tombé
un
livre
ouvert
la
retrouvait
au
déshabillé
avec
son
odeur
de
violette
son
désordre
de
bonne
fille
dun
effet
charmant
parmi
ces
richesses
tandis
que
les
fauteuils
larges
comme
des
lits
et
les
canapés
profonds
comme
des
alcôves
invitaient
à
des
somnolences
oublieuses
de
lheure
à
des
tendresses
rieuses
chuchotées
dans
lombre
des
coins
satin
alla
sétendre
près
de
la
cheminée
au
fond
dun
canapé
elle
avait
allumé
une
cigarette
mais
vandeuvres
samusait
à
lui
faire
une
scène
atroce
de
jalousie
en
la
menaçant
de
lui
envoyer
des
témoins
si
elle
détournait
encore
nana
de
ses
devoirs
philippe
et
georges
se
mettaient
de
la
partie
la
taquinaient
la
pinçaient
si
fort
quelle
finit
par
crier
chérie
chérie
faisles
donc
tenir
tranquilles
ils
sont
encore
après
moi
voyons
laissezla
dit
nana
sérieusement
je
ne
veux
pas
quon
la
tourmente
vous
le
savez
bien
et
toi
mon
chat
pourquoi
te
fourrestu
toujours
avec
eux
puisquils
sont
si
peu
raisonnables
satin
toute
rouge
tirant
la
langue
alla
dans
le
cabinet
de
toilette
dont
la
porte
grande
ouverte
laissait
voir
la
pâleur
des
marbres
éclairée
par
la
lumière
laiteuse
dun
globe
dépoli
où
brûlait
une
flamme
de
gaz
alors
nana
causa
avec
les
quatre
hommes
en
maîtresse
de
maison
pleine
de
charme
elle
avait
lu
dans
la
journée
un
roman
qui
faisait
grand
bruit
lhistoire
dune
fille
et
elle
se
révoltait
elle
disait
que
tout
cela
était
faux
témoignant
dailleurs
une
répugnance
indignée
contre
cette
littérature
immonde
dont
la
prétention
était
de
rendre
la
nature
comme
si
lon
pouvait
tout
montrer
comme
si
un
roman
ne
devait
pas
être
écrit
pour
passer
une
heure
agréable
en
matière
de
livres
et
de
drames
nana
avait
des
opinions
très
arrêtées
elle
voulait
des
oeuvres
tendres
et
nobles
des
choses
pour
la
faire
rêver
et
lui
grandir
lâme
puis
la
conversation
étant
tombée
sur
les
troubles
qui
agitaient
paris
des
articles
incendiaires
des
commencements
démeute
à
la
suite
dappels
aux
armes
lancés
chaque
soir
dans
les
réunions
publiques
elle
semporta
contre
les
républicains
que
voulaientils
donc
ces
sales
gens
qui
ne
se
lavaient
jamais
estce
quon
nétait
pas
heureux
estce
que
lempereur
navait
pas
tout
fait
pour
le
peuple
une
jolie
ordure
le
peuple
elle
le
connaissait
elle
pouvait
en
parler
et
oubliant
les
respects
quelle
venait
dexiger
à
table
pour
son
petit
monde
de
la
rue
de
la
gouttedor
elle
tapait
sur
les
siens
avec
des
dégoûts
et
des
peurs
de
femme
arrivée
laprèsmidi
justement
elle
avait
lu
dans
le
figaro
le
compte
rendu
dune
séance
de
réunion
publique
poussée
au
comique
dont
elle
riait
encore
à
cause
des
mots
dargot
et
de
la
sale
tête
dun
pochard
qui
sétait
fait
expulser
oh
ces
ivrognes
ditelle
dun
air
répugné
non
voyezvous
ce
serait
un
grand
malheur
pour
tout
le
monde
leur
république
ah
que
dieu
nous
conserve
lempereur
le
plus
longtemps
possible
dieu
vous
entendra
chère
répondit
gravement
muffat
allez
lempereur
est
solide
il
aimait
à
lui
voir
ces
bons
sentiments
tous
deux
sentendaient
en
politique
vandeuvres
et
le
capitaine
hugon
eux
aussi
ne
tarissaient
pas
en
plaisanteries
contre
les
voyous
des
braillards
qui
fichaient
le
camp
dès
quils
apercevaient
une
baïonnette
georges
ce
soirlà
restait
pâle
lair
sombre
qu
atil
donc
ce
bébé
demanda
nana
en
sapercevant
de
son
malaise
moi
rien
jécoute
murmuratil
mais
il
souffrait
au
sortir
de
table
il
avait
entendu
philippe
plaisanter
avec
la
jeune
femme
et
maintenant
cétait
philippe
ce
nétait
pas
lui
qui
se
trouvait
près
delle
toute
sa
poitrine
se
gonflait
et
éclatait
sans
quil
sût
pourquoi
il
ne
pouvait
les
tolérer
lun
près
de
lautre
des
idées
si
vilaines
le
serraient
à
la
gorge
quil
éprouvait
une
honte
dans
son
angoisse
lui
qui
riait
de
satin
qui
avait
accepté
steiner
puis
muffat
puis
tous
les
autres
il
se
révoltait
il
voyait
rouge
à
la
pensée
que
philippe
pourrait
un
jour
toucher
à
cette
femme
tiens
prends
bijou
ditelle
pour
le
consoler
en
lui
passant
le
petit
chien
endormi
sur
sa
jupe
et
georges
redevint
gai
tenant
quelque
chose
delle
cette
bête
toute
chaude
de
ses
genoux
la
conversation
était
tombée
sur
une
perte
considérable
éprouvée
par
vandeuvres
la
veille
au
cercle
impérial
muffat
nétait
pas
joueur
et
sétonnait
mais
vandeuvres
souriant
fit
une
allusion
à
sa
ruine
prochaine
dont
paris
causait
déjà
peu
importait
le
genre
de
mort
le
tout
était
de
bien
mourir
depuis
quelque
temps
nana
le
voyait
nerveux
avec
un
pli
cassé
de
la
bouche
et
de
vacillantes
lueurs
au
fond
de
ses
yeux
clairs
il
gardait
sa
hauteur
aristocratique
la
fine
élégance
de
sa
race
appauvrie
et
ce
nétait
encore
par
moments
quun
court
vertige
tournant
sous
ce
crâne
vidé
par
le
jeu
et
les
femmes
une
nuit
couché
près
delle
il
lavait
effrayée
en
lui
contant
une
histoire
atroce
il
rêvait
de
senfermer
dans
son
écurie
et
de
se
faire
flamber
avec
ses
chevaux
quand
il
aurait
tout
mangé
son
unique
espérance
à
cette
heure
était
dans
un
cheval
lusignan
quil
préparait
pour
le
prix
de
paris
il
vivait
sur
ce
cheval
qui
portait
son
crédit
ébranlé
chaque
exigence
de
nana
il
la
remettait
au
mois
de
juin
si
lusignan
gagnait
bah
ditelle
en
plaisantant
il
peut
bien
perdre
puisquil
va
tous
les
nettoyer
aux
courses
il
se
contenta
de
répondre
par
un
mince
sourire
mystérieux
puis
légèrement
propos
je
suis
permis
de
donner
votre
nom
à
mon
outsider
une
pouliche
nana
nana
cela
sonne
bien
vous
nêtes
point
fâchée
fâchée
pourquoi
ditelle
ravie
au
fond
la
causerie
continuait
parlait
dune
prochaine
exécution
capitale
où
la
jeune
femme
brûlait
daller
lorsque
satin
parut
à
la
porte
du
cabinet
de
toilette
en
lappelant
dun
ton
de
prière
elle
se
leva
aussitôt
elle
laissa
ces
messieurs
mollement
étendus
achevant
leur
cigare
discutant
une
grave
question
la
part
de
responsabilité
chez
un
meurtrier
atteint
dalcoolisme
chronique
dans
le
cabinet
de
toilette
zoé
tombée
sur
une
chaise
pleurait
à
chaudes
larmes
tandis
que
satin
vainement
tâchait
de
la
consoler
quoi
donc
demanda
nana
surprise
oh
chérie
parlelui
dit
satin
il
vingt
minutes
que
je
veux
lui
faire
entendre
raison
elle
pleure
parce
que
tu
las
appelée
dinde
oui
madame
cest
bien
dur
cest
bien
dur
bégaya
zoé
étranglée
par
une
nouvelle
crise
de
sanglots
du
coup
ce
spectacle
attendrit
la
jeune
femme
elle
eut
de
bonnes
paroles
et
comme
lautre
ne
se
calmait
pas
elle
saccroupit
devant
elle
la
prit
à
la
taille
dans
un
geste
de
familiarité
affectueuse
mais
bête
jai
dit
dinde
comme
jaurais
dit
autre
chose
estce
que
je
sais
jétais
en
colère
là
jai
eu
tort
calmetoi
moi
qui
aime
tant
madame
balbutiait
zoé
après
tout
ce
que
jai
fait
pour
madame
alors
nana
embrassa
la
femme
de
chambre
puis
voulant
montrer
quelle
nétait
pas
fâchée
elle
lui
donna
une
robe
quelle
avait
mise
trois
fois
leurs
querelles
finissaient
toujours
par
des
cadeaux
zoé
se
tamponnait
les
yeux
avec
son
mouchoir
elle
emporta
la
robe
sur
son
bras
elle
dit
encore
quon
était
bien
triste
à
la
cuisine
que
julien
et
françois
navaient
pas
pu
manger
tant
la
colère
de
madame
leur
coupait
lappétit
et
madame
leur
envoya
un
louis
comme
un
gage
de
réconciliation
le
chagrin
autour
delle
la
faisait
trop
souffrir
nana
retournait
au
salon
heureuse
davoir
arrangé
cette
brouille
qui
linquiétait
sourdement
pour
le
lendemain
lorsque
satin
lui
parla
vivement
à
loreille
elle
se
plaignait
elle
menaçait
de
sen
aller
si
ces
hommes
la
taquinaient
encore
et
elle
exigeait
que
sa
chérie
les
flanquât
tous
à
la
porte
cette
nuitlà
ça
leur
apprendrait
puis
ce
serait
si
gentil
de
rester
seules
toutes
les
deux
nana
reprise
de
souci
jurait
que
ce
nétait
pas
possible
alors
lautre
la
rudoya
en
enfant
violente
imposant
son
autorité
je
veux
entendstu
renvoieles
ou
cest
moi
qui
file
et
elle
rentra
dans
le
salon
elle
sétendit
au
fond
dun
divan
à
lécart
près
de
la
fenêtre
silencieuse
et
comme
morte
ses
grands
yeux
fixés
sur
nana
attendant
ces
messieurs
concluaient
contre
les
nouvelles
théories
criminalistes
avec
cette
belle
invention
de
lirresponsabilité
dans
certains
cas
pathologiques
il
n
avait
plus
de
criminels
il
n
avait
que
des
malades
la
jeune
femme
qui
approuvait
de
la
tête
cherchait
de
quelle
façon
elle
congédierait
le
comte
les
autres
allaient
partir
mais
lui
sentêterait
sûrement
en
effet
lorsque
philippe
se
leva
pour
se
retirer
georges
le
suivit
aussitôt
sa
seule
inquiétude
était
de
laisser
son
frère
derrière
lui
vandeuvres
resta
quelques
minutes
encore
il
tâtait
le
terrain
il
attendait
de
savoir
si
par
hasard
une
affaire
nobligerait
pas
muffat
à
lui
céder
la
place
puis
quand
il
le
vit
sinstaller
carrément
pour
la
nuit
il
ninsista
pas
il
prit
congé
en
homme
de
tact
mais
comme
il
se
dirigeait
vers
la
porte
il
aperçut
satin
avec
son
regard
fixe
et
comprenant
sans
doute
amusé
il
vint
lui
serrer
la
main
hein
nous
ne
sommes
pas
fâchés
murmuratil
pardonnemoi
tu
es
la
plus
chic
parole
dhonneur
satin
dédaigna
de
répondre
elle
ne
quittait
pas
des
yeux
nana
et
le
comte
restés
seuls
ne
se
gênant
plus
muffat
était
venu
se
mettre
près
de
la
jeune
femme
et
lui
avait
pris
les
doigts
quil
baisait
alors
elle
cherchant
une
transition
demanda
si
sa
fille
estelle
allait
mieux
la
veille
il
sétait
plaint
de
la
tristesse
de
cette
enfant
il
ne
pouvait
vivre
une
journée
heureuse
chez
lui
avec
sa
femme
toujours
dehors
et
sa
fille
enfermée
dans
un
silence
glacé
nana
pour
ces
affaires
de
famille
se
montrait
toujours
pleine
de
bons
avis
et
comme
muffat
sabandonnant
la
chair
et
lesprit
détendus
recommençait
ses
doléances
si
tu
la
mariais
ditelle
en
se
souvenant
de
la
promesse
quelle
avait
faite
tout
de
suite
elle
osa
parler
de
daguenet
le
comte
à
ce
nom
eut
une
révolte
jamais
après
ce
quelle
lui
avait
appris
elle
fit
létonnée
puis
éclata
de
rire
et
le
prenant
par
le
cou
oh
le
jaloux
si
cest
possible
raisonne
un
peu
tavait
dit
du
mal
de
moi
jétais
furieuse
aujourdhui
je
serais
désolée
mais
pardessus
lépaule
de
muffat
elle
rencontra
le
regard
de
satin
inquiète
elle
le
lâcha
elle
continua
gravement
mon
ami
il
faut
que
ce
mariage
se
fasse

ne
veux
pas
empêcher
le
bonheur
de
ta
fille
ce
jeune
homme
est
très
bien
tu
ne
saurais
trouver
mieux
et
elle
se
lança
dans
un
éloge
extraordinaire
de
daguenet
le
comte
lui
avait
repris
les
mains
il
ne
disait
plus
non
il
verrait
causerait
de
cela
puis
comme
il
parlait
de
se
coucher
elle
baissa
la
voix
elle
donna
des
raisons
impossible
elle
était
indisposée
sil
laimait
un
peu
il
ninsisterait
pas
pourtant
il
sentêtait
il
refusait
de
partir
et
elle
faiblissait
lorsque
de
nouveau
elle
rencontra
le
regard
de
satin
alors
elle
fut
inflexible
non
ça
ne
se
pouvait
pas
le
comte
très
ému
lair
souffrant
sétait
levé
et
cherchait
son
chapeau
mais
à
la
porte
il
se
rappela
la
parure
de
saphirs
dont
il
sentait
lécrin
dans
sa
poche
il
voulait
la
cacher
au
fond
du
lit
pour
quelle
la
trouvât
avec
ses
jambes
en
se
couchant
la
première
une
surprise
de
grand
enfant
quil
méditait
depuis
le
dîner
et
dans
son
trouble
dans
son
angoisse
dêtre
renvoyé
ainsi
il
lui
remit
brusquement
lécrin
questce
que
cest
demandatelle
tiens
des
saphirs
ah
oui
cette
parure
comme
tu
es
aimable
dis
donc
mon
chéri
tu
crois
que
cest
la
même
dans
la
vitrine
ça
faisait
plus
deffet
ce
fut
tout
son
remerciement
elle
le
laissa
partir
il
venait
dapercevoir
satin
allongée
dans
son
attente
silencieuse
alors
il
regarda
les
deux
femmes
et
ninsistant
plus
se
soumettant
il
descendit
la
porte
du
vestibule
nétait
pas
refermée
que
satin
empoigna
nana
par
la
taille
dansa
chanta
puis
courant
vers
la
fenêtre
faut
voir
la
tête
quil
sur
le
trottoir
dans
lombre
des
rideaux
les
deux
femmes
saccoudèrent
à
la
rampe
de
fer
forgé
une
heure
sonnait
lavenue
de
villiers
déserte
allongeait
la
double
file
de
ses
becs
de
gaz
au
fond
de
cette
nuit
humide
de
mars
que
balayaient
de
grands
coups
de
vent
chargés
de
pluie
des
terrains
vagues
faisaient
des
trous
de
ténèbres
des
hôtels
en
construction
dressaient
leurs
échafaudages
sous
le
ciel
noir
et
elles
eurent
un
fou
rire
en
voyant
le
dos
rond
de
muffat
qui
sen
allait
le
long
du
trottoir
mouillé
avec
le
reflet
éploré
de
son
ombre
au
travers
de
cette
plaine
glaciale
et
vide
du
nouveau
paris
mais
nana
fit
taire
satin
prends
garde
les
sergents
de
ville
alors
elles
étouffèrent
leurs
rires
regardant
avec
une
peur
sourde
de
lautre
côté
de
lavenue
deux
figures
noires
qui
marchaient
dun
pas
cadencé
nana
dans
son
luxe
dans
sa
royauté
de
femme
obéie
avait
conservé
une
épouvante
de
la
police
naimant
pas
à
en
entendre
parler
pas
plus
que
de
la
mort
elle
éprouvait
un
malaise
quand
un
sergent
de
ville
levait
les
yeux
sur
son
hôtel
ne
savait
jamais
avec
ces
genslà
ils
pourraient
très
bien
les
prendre
pour
des
filles
sils
les
entendaient
rire
à
cette
heure
de
nuit
satin
sétait
serrée
contre
nana
dans
un
petit
frisson
pourtant
elles
restèrent
intéressées
par
lapproche
dune
lanterne
dansante
au
milieu
des
flaques
de
la
chaussée
cétait
une
vieille
chiffonnière
qui
fouillait
les
ruisseaux
satin
la
reconnut
tiens
ditelle
la
reine
pomaré
avec
son
cachemire
dosier
et
tandis
quun
coup
de
vent
leur
fouettait
à
la
face
une
poussière
deau
elle
racontait
à
sa
chérie
lhistoire
de
la
reine
pomaré
oh
une
fille
superbe
autrefois
qui
occupait
tout
paris
de
sa
beauté
et
un
chien
et
un
toupet
les
hommes
conduits
comme
des
bêtes
de
grands
personnages
pleurant
dans
son
escalier
présent
elle
se
soûlait
les
femmes
du
quartier
pour
rire
un
peu
lui
faisaient
boire
de
labsinthe
puis
sur
les
trottoirs
les
galopins
la
poursuivaient
à
coups
de
pierre
enfin
une
vraie
dégringolade
une
reine
tombée
dans
la
crotte
nana
écoutait
toute
froide
tu
vas
voir
ajouta
satin
elle
siffla
comme
un
homme
la
chiffonnière
qui
se
trouvait
sous
la
fenêtre
leva
la
tête
et
se
montra
à
la
lueur
jaune
de
sa
lanterne
cétait
dans
ce
paquet
de
haillons
sous
un
foulard
en
loques
une
face
bleuie
couturée
avec
le
trou
édenté
de
la
bouche
et
les
meurtrissures
enflammées
des
yeux
et
nana
devant
cette
vieillesse
affreuse
de
fille
noyée
dans
le
vin
eut
un
brusque
souvenir
vit
passer
au
fond
des
ténèbres
la
vision
de
chamont
cette
irma
danglars
cette
ancienne
roulure
comblée
dans
et
dhonneurs
montant
le
perron
de
son
château
au
milieu
dun
village
prosterné
alors
comme
satin
sifflait
encore
riant
de
la
vieille
qui
ne
la
voyait
pas
finis
donc
les
sergents
de
ville
murmuratelle
dune
voix
changée
rentrons
vite
mon
chat
les
pas
cadencés
revenaient
elles
fermèrent
la
fenêtre
en
se
retournant
nana
grelottante
les
cheveux
mouillés
resta
un
instant
saisie
devant
son
salon
comme
si
elle
avait
oublié
et
quelle
fût
rentrée
dans
un
endroit
inconnu
elle
retrouvait
là
un
air
si
tiède
si
parfumé
quelle
en
éprouvait
une
surprise
heureuse
les
richesses
entassées
les
meubles
anciens
les
étoffes
de
soie
et
dor
les
ivoires
les
bronzes
dormaient
dans
la
lumière
rose
des
lampes
tandis
que
de
tout
lhôtel
muet
montait
la
sensation
pleine
dun
grand
luxe
la
solennité
des
salons
de
réception
lampleur
confortable
de
la
salle
à
manger
le
recueillement
du
vaste
escalier
avec
la
douceur
des
tapis
et
des
sièges
cétait
un
élargissement
brusque
dellemême
de
ses
besoins
de
domination
et
de
jouissance
de
son
envie
de
tout
avoir
pour
tout
détruire
jamais
elle
navait
senti
si
profondément
la
force
de
son
sexe
elle
promena
un
lent
regard
elle
dit
dun
air
de
grave
philosophie
ah
bien
tout
de
même
joliment
raison
de
profiter
quand

jeune
mais
déjà
satin
sur
les
peaux

roulait
et
lappelait
viens
donc

donc
nana
se
déshabilla
dans
le
cabinet
de
toilette
pour
aller
plus
vite
elle
avait
pris
à
deux
mains
son
épaisse
chevelure
blonde
et
elle
la
secouait
audessus
de
la
cuvette
dargent
pendant
quune
grêle
de
longues
épingles
tombaient
sonnant
un
carillon
sur
le
métal
clair
xi
ce
dimanchelà
par
un
ciel
orageux
des
premières
chaleurs
de
juin
courait
le
grand
prix
de
paris
au
bois
de
boulogne
le
matin
le
soleil
sétait
levé
dans
une
poussière
rousse
mais
vers
onze
heures
au
moment
où
les
voitures
arrivaient
à
lhippodrome
de
longchamp
un
vent
du
sud
avait
balayé
les
nuages
des
vapeurs
grises
sen
allaient
en
longues
déchirures
des
trouées
dun
bleu
intense
sélargissaient
dun
bout
à
lautre
de
lhorizon
et
dans
les
coups
de
soleil
qui
tombaient
entre
deux
nuées
tout
flambait
brusquement
la
pelouse
peu
à
peu
emplie
dune
cohue
déquipages
de
cavaliers
et
de
piétons
la
piste
encore
vide
avec
la
guérite
du

en

au

de
lenceinte
du
pesage
les
cinq
tribunes
symétriques
étageant
leurs
galeries
de
briques
et
de
charpentes
audelà
la
vaste
plaine

se
noyait
dans
la
lumière
de
midi
bordée
de
petits
arbres
fermée
à
louest
par
les
coteaux
boisés
de
saintcloud
et
de
suresnes
que
dominait
le
profil
sévère
du
mont
valérien
nana
passionnée
comme
si
le
grand
prix
allait
décider
de
sa
fortune
voulut
se
placer
contre
la
barrière
à
côté
du
poteau
darrivée
elle
était
venue
de
très
bonne
heure
une
des
premières
dans
son
landau
garni
dargent
attelé
à
la
daumont
de
quatre
chevaux
blancs
magnifiques
un
cadeau
du
comte
muffat
quand
elle
avait
paru
à
lentrée
de
la
pelouse
avec
deux
postillons
trottant
sur
les
chevaux
de
gauche
et
deux
valets
de
pied
immobiles
derrière
la
voiture
une
bousculade
sétait
produite
parmi
la
foule
comme
au
passage
dune
reine
elle
portait
les
couleurs
de
lécurie
vandeuvres
bleu
et
blanc
dans
une
toilette
extraordinaire
le
petit
corsage
et
la
tunique
de
soie
bleue
collant
sur
le
corps
relevés
derrière
les
reins
en
un
pouf
énorme
ce
qui
dessinait
les
cuisses
dune
façon
hardie
par
ces
temps
de
jupes
ballonnées
puis
la
robe
de
satin
blanc
les
manches
de
satin
blanc
une
écharpe
de
satin
blanc
en
sautoir
le
tout
orné
dune
guipure
dargent
que
le
soleil
allumait
avec
ça
crânement
pour
ressembler
davantage
à
un
jockey
elle
sétait
posé
une
toque
bleue
à
plume
blanche
sur
son
chignon
dont
les
mèches
jaunes
lui
coulaient
au
milieu
du
dos
pareilles
à
une
énorme
queue
de
poils
roux
midi
sonnait
cétait
plus
de
trois
heures
à
attendre
pour
la
course
du
grand
prix
lorsque
le
landau
se
fut
rangé
contre
la
barrière
nana
se
mit
à
laise
comme
chez
elle
elle
avait
eu
le
caprice
damener
bijou
et
louiset
le
chien
couché
dans
ses
jupes
tremblait
de
froid
malgré
la
chaleur
tandis
que
lenfant
attifé
de
rubans
et
de
dentelles
avait
une
pauvre
petite
figure
de
cire
muette
pâlie
par
le
grand
air
cependant
la
jeune
femme
sans
sinquiéter
des
voisins
causait
très
haut
avec
georges
et
philippe
hugon
assis
devant
elle
sur
lautre
banquette
parmi
un
tel
tas
de
bouquets
des
roses
blanches
et
des
myosotis
bleus
quils
disparaissaient
jusquaux
épaules
alors
disaitelle
comme
il
massommait
je
lui
ai
montré
la
porte
et
voilà
deux
jours
quil
boude
elle
parlait
de
muffat
seulement
elle
navouait
pas
aux
jeunes
gens
la
vraie
cause
de
cette
première
querelle
un
soir
il
avait
trouvé
dans
sa
chambre
un
chapeau
dhomme
une
toquade
bête
un
passant
ramené
par
ennui
vous
ne

pas
comme
il

drôle
continuatelle
samusant
des
détails

au
fond
cest
un
cagot

ainsi
il
dit
sa
prière
tous
les
soirs
parfaitement
il
croit
que
je
ne
maperçois
de
rien
parce
que
je

pas
le
gêner
mais
je
le

de
loeil

son
signe
de
croix
en
se
tournant
pour
menjamber
et
aller
se
mettre
au
fond

malin
murmura
philippe
avant
et
après
alors
elle
eut
un
beau
rire
oui
cest
ça
avant
et
après
quand
je
mendors
je
lentends
de
nouveau
qui
bredouille
mais
ce
qui
devient
embêtant
cest
que
nous
ne
pouvons
plus
nous
disputer
sans
quil
retombe
dans
les
curés
moi
jai
toujours
eu
de
la
religion
sans
doute
blaguez
si
vous
voulez
ça

pas
de

trop
raseur
il

il
parle
de
ses
remords

avanthier
après
notre
attrapage

une
vraie
crise
je
nétais
pas
rassurée
du
tout
mais
elle
sinterrompit
pour
dire

amené
les

fagotés
ces
petits
les

dans
un
landau
aux
couleurs
sévères
un
luxe

de
bourgeois

de
bouillonnés
et
de
noeuds

heureuse
de
la
joie
dhenri
et
de
charles
assis
sur
la
banquette
de
devant
engoncés
dans
leurs
tuniques
trop
larges
de
collégien
mais
quand
le
landau
fut
venu
se
ranger
près
de
la
barrière
et
quelle
aperçut
nana
triomphante
au
milieu
de
ses
bouquets
avec
ses
quatre
chevaux
et
sa
livrée
elle
pinça
les
lèvres
très
raide
tournant
la
tête
mignon
au
contraire
la
mine
fraîche
loeil
gai
envoya
un
salut
de
la
main
lui
par
principe
restait
en
dehors
des
querelles
de
femmes
propos
reprit
nana
connaissezvous

petit
vieux
bien
propre
avec
des
dents
mauvaises

monsieur

du
comte
de
son
ménage
désuni
suppliant
de
rendre
le
bonheur
à
une
famille
très
poli
dailleurs
très
souriant
alors
moi
je
lui
ai
répondu
que

et
je
suis
engagée
à
remettre
le
comte
avec
sa
femme
vous
savez
ce
nest
pas
une
blague

serais
enchantée
de
les
voir

heureux
ces
gens
puis
ça
soulagerait
car
il
des
jours
vrai
où
il
massomme
sa
lassitude
des
derniers
mois
lui
échappait
dans
ce
cri
de
son
coeur
avec
ça
le
comte
paraissait
avoir
de
gros
embarras
dargent
il
était
soucieux
le
billet
signé
à
labordette
menaçait
de
nêtre
pas
payé
justement
la
comtesse

làbas
dit
georges
dont
les
regards
parcouraient
les
tribunes
où

immenses
jetaient
un
éblouissement

des
tandems
légers
fins
comme
des

dhorlogerie
qui
filaient
au

dun
bruit
de

par
moments
un
cavalier
passait
un
flot
de

effaré
à

sur

tout
dun

le
roulement
lointain
qui
venait
des

du

cessait
dans

frôlement
sourd

que
le
brouhaha
de

des
claquements
de

pour

un
conseil

des

labordette
la
regardait
dun
air
singulier
elle
se
pencha
elle
linterrogea
à
voix
basse
car
elle
savait
que
vandeuvres
le
chargeait
de
prendre
pour
lui
aux
bookmakers
afin
de
parier

à

sil

appris
quelque

dire
mais
labordette
sans

la
décida
à

il

comme
il
lentendrait
et
elle
ne

gaiement
en
le
laissant

mais
pas
de
nana
cest
une
rosse
ce
fut
un
accès
de
fou
rire
dans
la
voiture
les
jeunes
gens
trouvaient
le
mot
très
drôle
tandis
que
louiset
sans
comprendre
levait
ses
yeux
pâles
vers
sa
mère
dont
les
éclats
de
voix
le
surprenaient
labordette
dailleurs
ne
put
encore
séchapper
rose
mignon
lui
avait
fait
un
signe
et
elle
lui
donnait
des
ordres
il
inscrivait
des
chiffres
sur
un
calepin
puis
ce
furent
clarisse
et
gaga
qui
le
rappelèrent
pour
changer
leurs
paris
elles
avaient
entendu
des
mots
dans
la
foule
elles
ne
voulaient
plus
de
valerio
ii
et
prenaient
lusignan
lui
impassible
écrivait
enfin
il
se
sauva
le
vit
qui
disparaissait
de
lautre
côté
de
la
piste
entre
deux
tribunes
les
voitures
arrivaient
toujours
maintenant
elles
se
rangeaient
sur
une
cinquième
file
sélargissant
le
long
de
la
barrière
en
une
masse
profonde
toute
bariolée
par
les
taches
claires
des
chevaux
blancs
puis
audelà
cétait
une
débandade
dautres
voitures
isolées
comme
échouées
dans
lherbe
un
pêlemêle
de
roues
dattelages
jetés
en
tous
sens
côte
à
côte
de
biais
en
travers
tête
contre
tête
et
sur
les
nappes
de
gazon
restées
libres
les
cavaliers
trottaient
les
gens
à
pied
mettaient
des
groupes
noirs
continuellement
en
marche
audessus
de
ce
champ
de
foire
dans
la
chinure
brouillée
de
la
foule
les
buvettes
haussaient
leurs
tentes
de
toile
grise
que
les
coups
de
soleil
blanchissaient
mais
la
bousculade
des
tas
de
monde
des
remous
de
chapeaux
avait
surtout
lieu
autour
des
bookmakers
montés
dans
des
voitures
découvertes
gesticulant
comme
des
dentistes
avec
leurs
cotes
près
deux
collées
sur
de
hautes
planches
cest
bête
tout
de
même
de
ne
pas
savoir
pour
quel
cheval
parie
disait
nana
faut
que
je
risque
quelques
louis
moimême
elle
sétait
mise
debout
pour
choisir
un
bookmaker
qui
eût
une
bonne
figure
cependant
elle
oublia
son
désir
en
apercevant
toute
une
foule
de
sa
connaissance
outre
les
mignon
outre
gaga
clarisse
et
blanche
il
avait
là
à
droite
à
gauche
en
arrière
au
milieu
de
la
masse
des
voitures
qui
maintenant
emprisonnait
son
landau
tatan
néné
en
compagnie
de
maria
blond
dans
une
victoria
caroline
héquet
avec
sa
mère
et
deux
messieurs
dans
une
calèche

conduisant
ellemême
un
petit

enrubanné
aux
couleurs
de

méchain
orange
et
vert
léa
de
horn
sur
une
banquette
haute
de
mailcoach
où
une
bande
de
jeunes
gens
faisait
un
vacarme
plus
loin
dans
un
huitressorts
dune
tenue
aristocratique
lucy
stewart
en
robe
de
soie
noire
très
simple
prenait
des
airs
de
distinction
à
côté
dun
grand
jeune
homme
qui
portait
luniforme
des
aspirants
de
marine
mais
ce
qui
stupéfia
nana
ce
fut
de
voir
arriver
simonne
dans
un
tandem
que
steiner
conduisait
avec
un
laquais
derrière
immobile
les
bras
croisés
elle
était
éblouissante
toute
en
satin
blanc
rayé
de
jaune
couverte
de
diamants
depuis
la
ceinture
jusquau
chapeau
tandis
que
le
banquier
allongeant
un
fouet
immense
lançait
les
deux
chevaux
attelés
en
flèche
le
premier
un
petit
alezan
doré
au
trot
de
souris
le
second
un
grand
bai
brun
un
stepper
qui
trottait
les
jambes
hautes
bigre
dit
nana
ce
voleur
de
steiner
vient
donc
une
fois
encore
de
nettoyer
la
bourse
hein
simonne
atelle
un
chic
cest
trop
va
lempoigner
pourtant
elle
échangea
un
salut
de
loin
elle
agitait
la
main
elle
souriait
se
tournait
noubliait
personne
pour
se
faire
voir
de
tous
et
elle
continuait
de
causer
mais
cest
son
fils
que
lucy
traîne
avec
elle
il
est
gentil
en
uniforme
voilà
donc
pourquoi
elle
prend
son
air
vous
savez
quelle
peur
de
lui
et
quelle
se
fait
passer
pour
une
actrice
pauvre
jeune
homme
tout
de
même
il
ne
semble
pas
se
douter
bah
murmura
philippe
en
riant
quand
elle
voudra
elle
lui
trouvera
une
héritière
en
province
nana
se
taisait
elle
venait
dapercevoir
au
plus
épais
des
équipages
la
tricon
arrivée
dans
un
fiacre
doù
elle
ne
voyait
rien
la
tricon
était
tranquillement
montée
sur
le
siège
du
cocher
et
làhaut
redressant
sa
grande
taille
avec
sa
figure
noble
aux
longues
anglaises
elle
dominait
la
foule
elle
semblait
régner
sur
son
peuple
de
femmes
toutes
lui
souriaient
discrètement
elle
supérieure
affectait
de
ne
pas
les
connaître
elle
nétait
pas
là
pour
travailler
elle
suivait
les
courses
par
plaisir
joueuse
enragée
ayant
la
passion
des
chevaux
tiens
cet
idiot
de
la
faloise
dit
georges
tout
à
coup
ce
fut
un
étonnement
nana
ne
reconnaissait
plus
son
la
faloise
depuis
quil
avait
hérité
il
était
devenu
dun
chic
extraordinaire
le
col
brisé
vêtu
dune
étoffe
de
couleur
tendre
qui
collait
à
ses
maigres
épaules
coiffé
de
petits
bandeaux
il
affectait
un
dandinement
de
lassitude
une
voix
molle
avec
des
mots
dargot
des
phrases
quil
ne
se
donnait
pas
la
peine
de
finir
mais
il
est
très
bien
déclara
nana
séduite
gaga
et
clarisse
avaient
appelé
la
faloise
se
jetant
à
sa
tête
tâchant
de
le
reprendre
il
les
quitta
tout
de
suite
avec
un
déhanchement
de
blague
et
de
dédain
nana
léblouit
il
accourut
se
tint
sur
le
marchepied
de
la
voiture
et
comme
elle
le
plaisantait
au
sujet
de
gaga
il
murmura
ah
non
fini
la
vieille
garde
faut
plus
la
faire
et
puis
vous
savez
cest
vous
maintenant
juliette
il
avait
mis
la
main
sur
son
coeur
nana
riait
beaucoup
de
cette
déclaration
si
brusque
en
plein
air
mais
elle
reprit
dites
donc
ce
nest
pas
tout
ça
vous
faites
oublier
que
je
veux
parier
georges
tu
vois
ce
bookmaker
làbas
le
gros

avec
des

une

bégayait
la
faloise
moi
tout
sur
langlais
très
chic
si
langlais
gagne
à
chaillot
les
français
nana
fut
scandalisée
alors
discuta
les
mérites
des
chevaux
la
faloise
pour
affecter
dêtre
très
au
courant
les
traitait
tous
de
rosses
frangipane

par

eu
des

quant
à
valerio
ii
de
lécurie
corbreuse
il
nétait
pas
prêt
il
avait
eu
des
tranchées
en
avril
oh
cachait
ça
mais
lui
en
était
sûr
parole
dhonneur
et
il
finit
par
conseiller
hasard
un
cheval
de
lécurie
méchain
le
plus
défectueux
de
tous
dont
personne
ne
voulait
fichtre
hasard
une
forme
superbe
et
une
action
voilà
une
bête
qui
allait
surprendre
son
monde
non
dit
nana
je
vais
mettre
dix
louis
sur
lusignan
et
cinq
sur
boum
du
coup
la
faloise
éclata
mais
chère

il
sétranglait
philippe
fit
remarquer
que
pourtant
lusignan
avait
gagné
le
prix
des
cars
et
la
grande
poule
des
produits
mais
lautre
repartit
questce
que
ça
prouvait
rien
du
tout
au
contraire
il
fallait
se
défier
et
dailleurs
cétait
gresham
qui
montait
lusignan
alors
quon
lui
fichât
la
paix
gresham
avait
la
guigne
jamais
il
narrivait
et
dun
bout
à
lautre
de
la
pelouse
la
discussion
qui
sélevait
dans
le
landau
de
nana
semblait
sélargir
des
voix
glapissantes
montaient
la
passion
du
jeu
soufflait
allumant
les
visages
détraquant
les
gestes
tandis
que
les
bookmakers
perchés
sur
leurs
voitures
criaient
des
cotes
inscrivaient
des
chiffres
furieusement
il
n
avait
là
que
le
fretin
des
parieurs
les
forts
paris
se
faisaient
dans
lenceinte
du
pesage
et
cétait
une
âpreté
des
petites
bourses
risquant
cent
sous
toutes
les
convoitises
étalées
pour
un
gain
possible
de
quelques
louis
en
somme
la
grande
bataille
se
livrait
entre
spirit
et
lusignan
des
anglais
reconnaissables
se
promenaient
parmi
les
groupes
comme
chez

la
face
enflammée
triomphant

à

mais
le
bruit
courait
que
rose
mignon
avait
donné
commission
à
labordette
pour
deux
cents
louis
seule
la
tricon
assise
près
de
son
cocher
attendait
la
dernière
minute
très
froide
au
milieu
des
querelles
dominant
le
tapage
croissant
où
les
noms
des
chevaux
revenaient
dans
des
phrases
vives
de
parisiens
mêlées
aux
exclamations
gutturales
des
anglais
elle
écoutait
elle
prenait
des
notes
dun
air
de
majesté

disparaissait
dans
la

de

mais
la
faloise
leva
les
bras
en
lair
disant
jai
une
inspiration
je
mets
un
louis
sur
nana
bravo
je
mets
deux
louis
dit
georges
moi
trois
louis
ajouta
philippe
et
ils
montèrent
ils
firent
leur
cour
plaisamment
lançant
des
chiffres
comme
sils
sétaient
disputé
nana
aux
enchères
la
faloise
parlait
de
la
couvrir
dor
dailleurs
tout
le
monde

racoler
des

mais
comme
les
trois
jeunes
gens
séchappaient
pour
faire
de
la
propagande

leur
cria

je
nen
veux
pas

dix
louis
sur

et
cinq
sur

cependant
ils
sétaient
lancés
égayée
elle
les
regardait
se
couler
entre
les
roues
se
baisser
sous
les
têtes
des
chevaux
battre
la
pelouse
entière
dès
quils
reconnaissaient
quelquun
dans
une
voiture
ils
accouraient
ils
poussaient
nana
et
cétaient
de
grands
éclats
de
rire
qui
passaient
sur
la
foule
lorsque
parfois
ils
se
retournaient
triomphants
indiquant
des
nombres
avec
le
doigt
tandis
que
la
jeune
femme
debout
agitait
son
ombrelle
pourtant
ils
faisaient
dassez
pauvre
besogne
quelques
hommes
se
laissaient
convaincre
par
exemple
steiner
que
la
vue
de
nana
remuait
risqua
trois
louis
mais
les
femmes
refusaient
absolument
merci
pour
perdre
à
coup
sûr
puis
ce
nétait
pas
pressé
de
travailler
au
succès
dune
sale
fille
qui
les
écrasait
toutes
avec
ses
quatre
chevaux
blancs
ses
postillons

et

être

le

dans
le
brouhaha

le
questionna
sur
cette
hausse
brusque
de
la
cote
mais
il
répondit
évasivement
sans

des
demandes

produites
elle
dut
se
contenter
de
cette
explication
dailleurs

annonça
que

sil

la

sachevait
comme
inaperçue
dans
lattente
du

prix
lorsquun

creva
sur

depuis
un
instant
le
soleil
avait
disparu
un
jour
livide
assombrissait
la

leva
ce
fut
un
brusque
déluge
des
gouttes
énormes
des
paquets

qui
tombaient
il
eut
une
minute
de
confusion
des
cris
des
plaisanteries
des
jurements
au
milieu
du
sauvequipeut
des
piétons
galopant
et
se
réfugiant
sous
les
tentes
des
buvettes
dans
les
voitures
les
femmes
tâchaient
de
sabriter
tenaient
à
deux
mains
leurs
ombrelles
pendant
que
les
laquais
effarés
couraient
aux
capotes
mais
laverse
cessait
déjà
le
soleil
resplendissait
dans
la
poussière
de
pluie
qui
volait
encore
une
déchirure
bleue
souvrait
derrière
la
nuée
emportée
audessus
du
bois
et
cétait
comme
une
gaieté
du
ciel
soulevant
les
rires
des
femmes
rassurées
tandis
que
la
nappe
dor
dans
lébrouement
des
chevaux
dans
la
débandade
et
lagitation
de
cette
foule
trempée
qui
se
secouait
allumait
la
pelouse
toute
ruisselante
de
gouttes
de
cristal
ah

mouillé
mon
chéri
le
petit
sans

se
laissa
essuyer

la
jeune
femme
avait
pris
son
mouchoir
elle
tamponna
ensuite
bijou
qui
tremblait
plus
fort
ce
ne
serait
rien
quelques
taches
sur
le
satin
blanc
de
sa
toilette
mais
elle
sen
fichait
les
bouquets
rafraîchis
avaient
un
éclat
de
neige
et
elle
en
respirait
un
heureuse
mouillant
ses
lèvres
comme
dans
de
la
rosée
cependant
ce
coup
de
pluie
avait
brusquement
empli
les
tribunes
nana
regardait
avec
sa
jumelle
cette
distance
distinguait
seulement
une
masse
compacte
et
brouillée
entassée
sur
les
gradins
un
fond
sombre
que
les
taches
pâles
des
figures
éclairaient
le
soleil
glissait
par
des
coins
de
toiture
écornait
la
foule
assise
dun
angle
de
lumière
où
les
toilettes
semblaient
déteindre
mais
nana
samusait
surtout
des
dames
que
laverse
avait
chassées
des
rangées
de
chaises
alignées
sur
le
sable
au
pied
des
tribunes
comme
lentrée
de
lenceinte
du
pesage
était
absolument
interdite
aux

nana
faisait
des
remarques
pleines
daigreur
sur
toutes
ces
femmes
comme
il

quelle
trouvait
fagotées
avec
de
drôles

une
rumeur
courut
limpératrice

dans
la

tribune
centrale
un
pavillon
en
forme
de

dont
le
large
balcon
était
garni
de

croyais

cette
semaine
la
figure
raide
et
solennelle
du

paru
derrière
limpératrice
alors
les
jeunes
gens
plaisantèrent
regrettant
que
satin
ne
fût
pas
là
pour
aller
lui
taper
sur
le
ventre
mais
nana
rencontra
au
bout
de
sa
jumelle
la
tête
du
prince
décosse
dans
la
tribune
impériale
tiens
charles
criatelle
elle
le
trouvait

pour
garder
sa
situation
il
venait
de
rompre
la
faloise
carrément
rapporta
cette
histoire
à
la
jeune
femme
soffrant
de
nouveau
en
lappelant
sa
juliette
mais
elle
eut
un
beau
rire
elle
dit

devant

alors

elle
le
força
à

linterrompit
par
une
exclamation

cétait
bordenave
en

se
promenant
les

derrière
le

avec
un
chapeau
que
le
soleil
rougissait
et
une
redingote
graisseuse
blanchie
aux
coutures
un
bordenave
décati
par
la
faillite
mais
quand
même
furieux
étalant
sa
misère
parmi
le
beau
monde
avec
la
carrure
dun
homme
toujours
prêt
à
violer
la
fortune
bigre
quel
chic
ditil
lorsque
nana
lui
tendit
la
main
en
bonne
fille
puis
après
avoir
vidé
un
verre
de
champagne
il
eut
ce
mot
de
profond
regret
ah

jétais

veuxtu

une
idée

hein

bien
ça
et
il
resta
grognant
heureux
pourtant
de
la
revoir
car
disaitil
cette
sacrée
nana
lui
mettait
du
baume
dans
le
coeur
rien
qu
à
vivre
devant
lui
cétait
sa
fille
son
vrai
sang
le
cercle
grandissait
maintenant
la
faloise
versait
philippe
et
georges
racolaient
des
amis
une
poussée
lente
amenait
peu
à
peu
la
pelouse
entière
nana
jetait
à
chacun
un
rire
un
mot
drôle
les
bandes
de
buveurs
se
rapprochaient
tout
le
champagne
épars
marchait
vers
elle
il
n
avait
bientôt
plus
quune
foule
quun
vacarme
autour
de
son
landau
et
elle
régnait
parmi
les
verres
qui
se
tendaient
avec
ses
cheveux
jaunes
envolés
son
visage
de
neige
baigné
de
soleil
alors
au
sommet
pour
faire
crever
les
autres
femmes
quenrageait
son
triomphe
elle
leva
son
verre
plein
dans
son
ancienne
pose
de
vénus
victorieuse
mais
quelquun
la
touchait
parderrière
et
elle
fut
surprise
en
se
retournant
dapercevoir
mignon
sur
la
banquette
elle
disparut
un
instant
elle
sassit
à
son
côté
car
il
venait
lui
communiquer
une
chose
grave
mignon
disait
partout
que
sa
femme
était
ridicule
den
vouloir
à
nana
il
trouvait
ça
bête
et
inutile
voici
chère
murmuratil
méfietoi
ne
fais
pas
trop
enrager
rose
tu
comprends
jaime
mieux
te
prévenir
oui
elle
une
arme
et
comme
elle

jamais
pardonné
laffaire
de
la
petite
duchesse
une
arme
dit
nana
questce
que
ça
fiche
écoute
donc
cest
une
lettre
quelle
dû
trouver
dans
la
poche
de
fauchery
une
lettre
écrite
à
cette
rosse
de
fauchery
par
la
comtesse
muffat
et
dame
làdedans
cest
clair
ça
est
en
plein
alors
rose
veut
envoyer
la
lettre
au
comte
pour
se
venger
de
lui
et
de
toi
questce

répéta
nana
cest
drôle
ça
ah
ça

avec
fauchery
eh
bien
tant
mieux
elle
magaçait
nous
allons
rire
mais
non
je

reprit
vivement
mignon
un
joli
scandale
puis
nous
navons
rien
à
gagner
il
sarrêta
craignant
den
trop
dire
elle
sécriait
que
bien
sûr
elle
nirait
pas
repêcher
une
femme
honnête
mais
comme
il
insistait
elle
le
regarda
fixement
sans
doute
il
avait
peur
de
voir
fauchery
retomber
dans
son
ménage
sil
rompait
avec
la
comtesse
cétait
ce
que
rose
voulait
tout
en
se
vengeant
car
elle
gardait
une
tendresse
pour
le
journaliste
et
nana
devint
rêveuse
elle
songeait
à
la
visite
de
venot
un
plan
poussait
en
elle
tandis
que
mignon
tâchait
de
la
convaincre
mettons
que
rose
envoie
la
lettre
nestce
pas
il
un
esclandre
tu
es
mêlée
làdedans
dit
que
tu
es
la
cause
de
tout
dabord
le
comte
se
sépare
de
sa
femme
pourquoi
ça
ditelle
au
contraire
son
tour
elle
sinterrompit
elle
navait
pas
besoin
de
penser
tout
haut
enfin
elle
eut
lair
dentrer
dans
les
vues
de
mignon
pour
se
débarrasser
de
lui
et
comme
il
lui
conseillait
une
soumission
auprès
de
rose
par
exemple
une
petite
visite
sur
le
champ
de
courses
devant
tous
elle
répondit
quelle
verrait
quelle
réfléchirait
un
tumulte
la
fit
se
relever
sur
la
piste
des
chevaux
arrivaient
dans
un
coup
de
vent
cétait
le
prix
de
la
ville
de
paris
que
gagnait
cornemuse
maintenant
le
grand
prix
allait
être
couru
la
fièvre
augmentait
une
anxiété
fouettait
la
foule
piétinant
ondulant
dans
un
besoin
de
hâter
les
minutes
et
à
cette
heure
dernière
une
surprise
effarait
les
parieurs
la
hausse
continue
de
la
cote
de
nana
loutsider
de
lécurie
vandeuvres
des
messieurs
revenaient
à
chaque
instant
avec
une
cote
nouvelle
nana
était
à
trente
nana
était
à
vingtcinq
puis
à
vingt
puis
à
quinze
personne
ne
comprenait
une
pouliche
battue
sur
tous
les
hippodromes
une
pouliche
dont
le
matin
pas
un
parieur
ne
voulait
à
cinquante
que
signifiait
ce
brusque
affolement
les
uns
se
moquaient
en
parlant
dun
joli
nettoyage
pour
les
nigauds
qui
donnaient
dans
cette
farce
dautres
sérieux
inquiets
flairaient
làdessous
quelque
chose
de
louche
il
avait
un
coup
peutêtre
faisait
allusion
à
des
histoires
aux
vols
tolérés
des
champs
de
courses
mais
cette
fois
le
grand
nom
de
vandeuvres
arrêtait
les
accusations
et
les
sceptiques
lemportaient
en
somme
lorsquils
prédisaient
que
nana
arriverait
belle
dernière
qui
estce
qui
monte
nana
demanda
la
faloise
justement
la
vraie
nana
reparaissait
alors
ces
messieurs
donnèrent
à
la
question
un
sens
malpropre
en
éclatant
dun
rire
exagéré
nana
saluait
cest
price
réponditelle
et
la
discussion
recommença
price
était
une
célébrité
anglaise
inconnue
en
france
pourquoi
vandeuvres
avaitil
fait
venir
ce
jockey
lorsque
gresham
montait
nana
dordinaire
dailleurs
sétonnait
de
le
voir
confier
lusignan
à
ce
gresham
qui
narrivait
jamais
selon
la
faloise
mais
toutes
ces
remarques
se
noyaient
dans
les
plaisanteries
les
démentis
le
brouhaha
dun
pêlemêle
dopinions
extraordinaire
se
remettait
à
vider
des
bouteilles
de
champagne
pour
tuer
le
temps
puis
un
chuchotement
courut
les
groupes
sécartèrent
cétait
vandeuvres

affecta
dêtre
fâchée

heureuse
des
regards
jaloux
dont
lucy

et
les
autres
la
suivaient
derrière
elle
les
fils
hugon
et
la
faloise
restés
dans
le
landau
continuaient
à
faire
les
honneurs
de
son
champagne
elle
leur
criait

de

mais
vandeuvres
ayant

quelques
paroles
brèves
furent
échangées

jourlà
son
dernier
coup
de
cartes
si
ses
chevaux
ne
gagnaient
pas
sils
lui
emportaient
encore
les
sommes
considérables
pariées
sur
eux
cétait
un
désastre
un
écroulement
léchafaudage
de
son
crédit
les
hautes
apparences
que
gardait
son
existence
minée
pardessous
comme
vidée
par
le
désordre
et
la
dette
sabîmaient
dans
une
ruine
retentissante
et
nana
personne
non
plus
ne
lignorait
était
la
mangeuse
dhommes
qui
avait
achevé
celuilà
venue
la
dernière
dans
cette
fortune
ébranlée
nettoyant
la
place
racontait
des
caprices
fous
de
lor
semé
au
vent
une
partie
à
bade
où
elle
ne
lui
avait
pas
laissé
de
quoi
payer
lhôtel
une
poignée
de
diamants
jetée
sur
un
brasier
un
soir
divresse
pour
voir
si
ça
brûlait
comme
du
charbon
peu
à
peu
avec
ses
gros
membres
ses
rires
canailles
de
faubourienne
elle
sétait
imposée
à
ce
fils
si
appauvri
et
si
fin
dune
antique
race
cette
heure
il
risquait
tout
si
envahi
par
son
goût
du
bête
et
du
sale
quil
avait
perdu
jusqu
à
la
force
de
son
scepticisme
huit
jours
auparavant
elle
sétait
fait
promettre
un
château
sur
la
côte
normande
entre
le
havre
et
trouville
et
il
mettait
son
dernier
honneur
à
tenir
parole
seulement
elle
lagaçait
il
laurait
battue
tant
il
la
sentait
stupide
le
gardien
les
avait
laissés
entrer
dans
lenceinte
du
pesage
nosant
arrêter
cette
femme
au
bras
du
comte
nana
toute
gonflée
de
poser
enfin
le
pied
sur
cette
terre
défendue
sétudiait
marchait
avec
lenteur
devant
les
dames
assises
au
pied
des
tribunes
cétait
sur
dix
rangées
de
chaises
une
masse
profonde
de
toilettes
mêlant
leurs
couleurs
vives
dans
la
gaieté
du
plein
air
des
chaises
sécartaient
des
cercles
familiers
se
formaient
au
hasard
des
rencontres
comme
sous
un
quinconce
de
jardin
public
avec
des
enfants
lâchés
courant
dun
groupe
à
un
autre
et
plus
haut
les
tribunes
étageaient
leurs
gradins
chargés
de
foule
où
les
étoffes
claires
se
fondaient
dans
lombre
fine
des
charpentes
nana
dévisageait
ces
dames
elle
affecta
de
regarder
fixement
la
comtesse
sabine
puis
comme
elle
passait
devant
la
tribune
impériale
la
vue
de
muffat
debout
près
de
limpératrice
dans
sa
raideur
officielle
légaya
oh
quil
lair
bête
ditelle
très
haut
à
vandeuvres
elle
voulait
tout
visiter
ce
bout
de
parc
avec
ses
pelouses
ses
massifs
darbres
ne
lui
semblait
pas
si
drôle
un
glacier
avait
installé
un
grand
buffet
près
des
grilles
sous
un
champignon
rustique
couvert
de
chaume
des
gens
en
tas
gesticulaient
et
criaient
cétait
le
ring
côté
se
trouvaient
des
boxes
vides
et
désappointée
elle
découvrit
seulement
le
cheval
dun
gendarme
puis
il
avait
le
paddock
une
piste
de
cent
mètres
de
tour
où
un
garçon
décurie
promenait
valerio
ii
encapuchonné
et
voilà
beaucoup
dhommes
sur
le
gravier
des
allées
avec
la
tache
orange
de
leur
carte
à
la
boutonnière
une
promenade
continue
de
gens
dans
les
galeries
ouvertes
des
tribunes
ce
qui
lintéressa
une
minute
mais
vrai
ça
ne
valait
pas
la
peine
de
se
faire
de
la
bile
parce
quon
vous
empêchait
dentrer
làdedans
daguenet
et
fauchery
qui
passaient
la
saluèrent
elle
leur
fit
un
signe
ils
durent
sapprocher
et
elle
bêcha
lenceinte
du
pesage
puis
sinterrompant
tiens
le
marquis
de
chouard
comme
il
vieillit
sabîmetil
ce
vieuxlà
il
est
donc
toujours
enragé
alors
daguenet
raconta
le
dernier
coup
du
vieux
une
histoire
de
lavantveille
que
personne
ne
savait
encore
après
avoir
tourné
des
mois
il
venait
dacheter
à
gaga
sa
fille
amélie
trente
mille
francs
disaiton
eh
bien
cest
du
propre
cria
nana
révoltée
ayez
donc
des
filles
mais
j
songe
ça
doit
être
lili
qui
est
làbas
sur
la
pelouse
dans
un
coupé
avec
une
dame
aussi
je
reconnaissais
cette
figure
le
vieux
laura
sortie
vandeuvres
nécoutait
pas
impatient
désireux
de
se
débarrasser
delle
mais
fauchery
ayant
dit
en
sen
allant
que
si
elle
navait
pas
vu
les
bookmakers
elle
navait
rien
vu
le
comte
dut
la
conduire
malgré
une
répugnance
visible
et
du
coup
elle
fut
contente
ça
en
effet
cétait
curieux
une
rotonde
souvrait
entre
des
pelouses
bordées
de
jeunes
marronniers
et
là
formant
un
vaste
cercle
abrités
sous
les
feuilles
dun
vert
tendre
une
ligne
serrée
de
bookmakers
attendaient
les
parieurs
comme
dans
une
foire
pour
dominer
la
foule
ils
se
haussaient
sur
des
bancs
de
bois
ils
affichaient
leurs
cotes
près
deux
contre
les
arbres
tandis
que
loeil
au
guet
ils
inscrivaient
des
paris
sur
un
geste
sur
un
clignement
de
paupières
si
rapidement
que
des
curieux
béants
les
regardaient
sans
comprendre
cétait
une
confusion
des
chiffres
criés
des
tumultes
accueillant
les
changements
de
cote
inattendus
et
par
moments
redoublant
le
tapage
des
avertisseurs
débouchaient
en
courant
sarrêtaient
à
lentrée
de
la
rotonde
jetaient
violemment
un
cri
un
départ
une
arrivée
qui
soulevait
de
longues
rumeurs
dans
cette
fièvre
du
jeu
battant
au
soleil
sontils
drôles
murmura
nana
très
amusée
ils
ont
des
figures
à
lenvers
tiens
ce
grandlà
je
ne
voudrais
pas
le
rencontrer
toute
seule
au
fond
dun
bois
mais
vandeuvres
lui
montra
un
bookmaker
un
commis
de
nouveautés
qui
avait
gagné
trois
millions
en
deux
ans
la
taille
grêle
délicat
et
blond
il
était
entouré
dun
respect
lui
parlait
en
souriant
des
gens
stationnaient
pour
le
voir
enfin
ils
quittaient
la
rotonde
lorsque
vandeuvres
adressa
un
léger
signe
de
tête
à
un
autre
bookmaker
qui
se
permit
alors
de
lappeler
cétait
un
de
ses
anciens
cochers
énorme
les
épaules
dun
boeuf
la
face
haute
en
couleur
maintenant
quil
tentait
la
fortune
aux
courses
avec
des
fonds
dorigine
louche
le
comte
tâchait
de
le
pousser
le
chargeant
de
ses
paris
secrets
le
traitant
toujours
en
domestique
dont
ne
se
cache
pas
malgré
cette
protection
cet
homme
avait
perdu
coup
sur
coup
des
sommes
très
lourdes
et
lui
aussi
jouait
ce
jourlà
sa
carte
suprême
les
yeux
pleins
de
sang
crevant
dapoplexie
eh
bien
maréchal
demanda
tout
bas
vandeuvres
pour
combien
en
avezvous
donné
pour
cinq
mille
louis
monsieur
le
comte
répondit
le
bookmaker
en
baissant
également
la
voix
hein
cest
joli
je
vous
avouerai
que
jai
baissé
la
cote
je
lai
mise
à
trois
vandeuvres
eut
lair
très
contrarié
non
non
je
ne
veux
pas
remettezla
à
deux
tout
de
suite
je
ne
vous
dirai
plus
rien
maréchal
oh
maintenant
questce
que
ça
peut
faire
à
monsieur
le
comte
reprit
lautre
avec
un
sourire
humble
de
complice
il
fallait
bien
attirer
le
monde
pour
donner
vos
deux
mille
louis
alors
vandeuvres
le
fit
taire
mais
comme
il
séloignait
maréchal
pris
dun
souvenir
regretta
de
ne
pas
lavoir
questionné
sur
la
hausse
de
sa
pouliche
il
était
propre
si
la
pouliche
avait
des
chances
lui
qui
venait
de
la
donner
pour
deux
cents
louis
à
cinquante
nana
qui
ne
comprenait
rien
aux
paroles
chuchotées
par
le
comte
nosa
pourtant
demander
de
nouvelles
explications
il
paraissait
plus
nerveux
il
la
confia
brusquement
à
labordette
quils
trouvèrent
devant
la
salle
du
pesage
vous
la
ramènerez
ditil
moi
jai
à
faire
au
revoir
et
il
entra
dans
la
salle
une
pièce
étroite
basse
de
plafond
encombrée
dune
grande
balance
cétait
comme
une
salle
des
bagages
dans
une
station
de
banlieue
nana
eut
encore
là
une
grosse
déception
elle
qui
se
figurait
quelque
chose
de
très
vaste
une
machine
monumentale
pour
peser
les
chevaux
comment
ne
pesait
que
les
jockeys
alors
ça
ne
valait
pas
la
peine
de
faire
tant
dembarras
avec
leur
pesage
dans
la
balance
un
jockey
lair
idiot
ses
harnais
sur
les
genoux
attendait
quun
gros
homme
en
redingote
eût
vérifié
son
poids
tandis
quun
garçon
décurie
à
la
porte
tenait
le
cheval
cosinus
autour
duquel
la
foule
sattroupait
silencieuse
absorbée
allait
fermer
la
piste
labordette
pressait
nana
mais
il
revint
sur
ses
pas
pour
lui
montrer
un
petit
homme
causant
avec
vandeuvres
à
lécart
tiens
voilà
price
ditil
ah
oui
celui
qui
monte
murmuratelle
en
riant
et
elle
le
trouva
joliment
laid
tous
les
jockeys
lui
avaient
lair
crétin
sans
doute
disaitelle
parce
quon
les
empêchait
de
grandir
celuilà
un
homme
de
quarante
ans
paraissait
un
vieil
enfant
desséché
avec
une
longue
figure
maigre
creusée
de
plis
dure
et
morte
le
corps
était
si
noueux
si
réduit
que
la
casaque
bleue
aux
manches
blanches
semblait
jetée
sur
du
bois
non
tu
sais
repritelle
en
sen
allant
il
ne
ferait
pas
mon
bonheur
une
cohue
emplissait
encore
la
piste
dont
lherbe
mouillée
et
piétinée
était
devenue
noire
devant
les
deux
tableaux
indicateurs
très
hauts
sur
leur
colonne
de
fonte
la
foule
se
pressait
levant
la
tête
accueillant
dun
brouhaha
chaque
numéro
de
cheval
quun
fil
électrique
relié
à
la
salle
du

faisait
apparaître
des
messieurs

ne
fit
que
traverser
au
bras
de
labordette
la
cloche
pendue
au
mât
de

sonnait
avec
persistance
pour
quon
évacuât

et
le
champagne

cessa
de
boire
mais
nana
restait
surprise
de
trouver
gaga
dans
sa
voiture
avec
bijou
et
louiset
sur
les
genoux
gaga
sétait
décidée
pour
se
rapprocher
de
la
faloise
tout
en
racontant
quelle
avait
voulu
embrasser

elle
adorait
les
enfants

et
lili
demanda
nana
cest

elle
qui

làbas
dans
le

quelque

pris
une

hier
jai
dû
garder
le
lit
tant
javais
pleuré
et
aujourdhui
je
ne

hein
tu
sais
quelle
était
mon
opinion
je
ne
voulais
pas
je
lavais
fait
élever
dans
un
couvent
pour
un
bon
mariage
et
des
conseils
sévères
et
une
surveillance
continuelle
eh
bien
chère
cest
elle
qui
voulu
oh
une
scène
des
larmes
des
mots
désagréables
au
point
même
que
je
lui
ai
allongé
une
calotte
elle
sennuyait
trop
elle
voulait
passer
alors
quand
elle
sest
mise
à
dire
cest
pas

après
tout
qui

je
lui
ai
dit
tu
es
une
misérable
tu

et
ça
sest
fait
jai
consenti
à
arranger
ça
mais
voilà
mon
dernier
espoir
fichu
moi
qui
avais
rêvé
ah
des
choses
si
bien
le
bruit
dune
querelle
les
fit
se
lever
cétait
georges
qui
défendait
vandeuvres
contre
des
rumeurs

courant
dans
les
groupes
pourquoi
dire
quil

criait
le
jeune
homme
hier
au
salon
des

louis
oui

affirma
philippe
et
il

sur

si
nana
est
à

il
n
est
pour
rien
cest
ridicule
de
prêter
aux
gens
tant
de
calculs
où
serait
son
intérêt
labordette
écoutait
dun
air
tranquille
et
haussant
les
épaules
laissez
donc
il
faut
bien
quon
parle
le
comte
vient
encore
de
parier
cinq
cents
louis
au
moins
sur
lusignan
et
sil
demandé
une
centaine
de
louis
de
nana
cest
parce
quun
propriétaire
doit
toujours
avoir
lair
de
croire
à
ses
chevaux
et
zut
questce
que
ça

clama
la
faloise
en
agitant
les
bras
cest
spirit
qui

la

bravo
langleterre
un
long
frémissement
secouait
la
foule
pendant
quune
nouvelle
volée
de
la
cloche
annonçait
larrivée
des
chevaux
dans
la
piste
alors
nana
pour
bien
voir
monta
debout
sur
une
banquette
de
son
landau
foulant
aux
pieds
les
bouquets
les
myosotis
et
les
roses
dun
regard
circulaire
elle
embrassait
lhorizon
immense
cette
heure
dernière
de
fièvre
cétait
dabord
la
piste
vide
fermée
de
ses
barrières
grises
où
salignaient
des
sergents
de
ville
de
deux
en
deux
poteaux
et
la
bande
dherbe
boueuse
devant
elle
sen
allait
reverdie
tournait
au
loin
en
un
tapis
de
velours
tendre
puis
au
centre
en
baissant
les
yeux
elle
voyait
la
pelouse
toute
grouillante
dune
foule
haussée
sur
les
pieds
accrochée
aux
voitures
soulevée
et
heurtée
dans
un
coup
de
passion
avec
les
chevaux
qui
hennissaient
les
toiles
des
tentes
qui
claquaient
les
cavaliers
qui
lançaient
leurs
bêtes
parmi
les
piétons
courant
saccouder
aux
barrières
tandis
que
de
lautre
côté
quand
elle
se
tournait
vers
les
tribunes
les
figures
se
rapetissaient
les
masses
profondes
de
têtes
nétaient
plus
quun
bariolage
emplissant
les
allées
les
gradins
les
terrasses
où
un
entassement
de
profils
noirs
se
détachait
dans
le
ciel
et
audelà
encore
autour
de
lhippodrome
elle
dominait
la
plaine
derrière
le
moulin
couvert
de
lierre
à
droite
il
avait
un
enfoncement
de
prairies
coupées
de
grands
ombrages
en
face
jusqu
à
la
seine
coulant
au
bas
du
coteau
se
croisaient
des
avenues
de
parc
où
attendaient
des
files
immobiles
déquipages
puis
vers
boulogne
à
gauche
le
pays
élargi
de

ouvrait
une
trouée
sur
les
lointains
bleuâtres
de
meudon
que
barrait
une
allée
de
pawlonias
dont
les
têtes
roses
sans
une
feuille
faisaient
une
nappe
de
laque
vive
du
monde
arrivait
toujours
une
traînée
de
fourmilière
venait
de
làbas
par
le
mince
ruban
dun
chemin
à
travers
les
terres
pendant
que
très
loin
du
côté
de
paris
le
public
qui
ne
payait
pas
un
troupeau
campant
dans
les
futaies
mettait
une
ligne
mouvante
de
points
sombres
au
ras
du
bois
sous
les
arbres
mais
une
gaieté
tout
dun
coup
chauffa
les
cent
mille
âmes
qui
couvraient
ce
bout
de
champ
dun
remuement
dinsectes
affolés
sous
le
vaste
ciel
le
soleil
caché
depuis
un
quart
dheure
reparut
sépandit
en
un
lac
de
lumière
et
tout
flamba
de
nouveau
les
ombrelles
des
femmes
étaient
comme
des
boucliers
dor
innombrables
audessus
de
la
foule
applaudit
le
soleil
des
rires
le
saluaient
des
bras
se
tendaient
pour
écarter
les
nuages
cependant
un
officier
de
paix
sen
allait
seul
au
milieu
de
la
piste
déserte
plus
haut
vers
la
gauche
un
homme
parut
un
drapeau
rouge
à
la
main
cest
le

le
baron
de
mauriac
répondit
labordette
à
une
question
de
nana
autour
de
la
jeune
femme
parmi
les
hommes
qui
se
pressaient
jusque
sur
les
marchepieds
de
sa
voiture
des
exclamations
sélevaient
une
conversation
continuait
sans
suite
par
mots
jetés
sous
le
coup
immédiat
des
impressions
philippe
et
georges
bordenave
la
faloise
ne

se
débattait
pour

le
raisonner
tous

mais
le

le

quon
apercevait
au

comme
un
mince
trait
noir
navait
pas
abaissé
son

les
chevaux
revinrent
après
un
temps
de

il
eut
encore
deux
faux
départs

le

lança
avec
une
adresse
qui
arracha
des

superbe

la

sétouffa
dans

qui
serrait
les

maintenant
les

le
coup

jouait
sur

un
silence
régna

comme

suspendues
des

haussaient
blanches
avec
des
tressaillements
au

en
un

confus
quand
ils
passèrent
devant

dans

ébranlement
du

avec
le
brusque

de

philippe
dans
un
élan
de
douleur
patriotique
cétait
un
sentiment
dangoisse
qui
commençait
à
étrangler
tout
ce
monde
entassé
encore
une
défaite
et
une
ardeur
de
voeu
extraordinaire
presque
religieuse
montait
pour
lusignan
pendant
quon
injuriait
spirit
avec
son
jockey
dune
gaieté
de
croquemort
parmi
la
foule
éparse
dans
lherbe
un
souffle
enlevait
des
bandes
les
semelles
en

des
cavaliers
coupaient
la
pelouse
dun
galop
furieux
et
nana
qui
tournait
lentement
sur
ellemême
voyait
à
ses
pieds
cette
houle
de
bêtes
et
de
gens
cette
mer
de
têtes
battue
et
comme
emportée
autour
de
la
piste
par
le
tourbillon
de
la
course
rayant
lhorizon
du
vif
éclair
des
jockeys
elle
les
avait
suivis
de

dans
la
fuite
des
croupes
dans
la
vitesse
allongée
des
jambes
qui
se
perdaient
et
prenaient
des
finesses
de
cheveux
maintenant
au
fond
ils
filaient
de
profil
tout
petits
délicats
sur
les
lointains
verdâtres
du
bois
puis
brusquement
ils
disparurent
derrière
un
grand
bouquet
darbres
plantés
au
milieu
de

une
stupeur

un
long

encore

mais
spirit
le
gagnait
et
derrière
lui
lusignan
avait
lâché
tandis
quun
autre

fut
lopinion
de

mais
lentement
la

toujours
dans
un
effort
continu
alors
une
émotion
immense

déclara

vandeuvres
était
fini
il
avait
gâté
son
coup
superbe
par
une
plate
bêtise
un
vol
idiot
en
chargeant
maréchal
un
bookmaker
véreux
de
donner
pour
son
compte
deux
mille
louis
contre
lusignan
histoire
de
rattraper
ses
mille
et
quelques
louis
ouvertement
pariés
une
misère
et
cela
prouvait
la
fêlure
au
milieu
du
dernier
craquement
de
sa
fortune
le
bookmaker
prévenu
que
le
favori
ne
gagnerait
pas
avait
réalisé
une
soixantaine
de
mille
francs
sur
ce
cheval
seulement
labordette

dinstructions

et
détaillées
était
allé
justement
lui
prendre
deux
cents
louis
sur

continuait
à
donner
à

dans
son
ignorance
du
vrai
coup
nettoyé
de
cent
mille
francs
sur
la
pouliche
en
perte
de
quarante
mille

qui
sentait
tout
crouler
sous
ses
pieds
avait
brusquement
compris
en
voyant
labordette
et
le
comte

ensemble
après
la
course
devant
la

et
dans
une
fureur

dans
une

de

publiquement
une
scène
affreuse

que
le

de

et
de

rappelait
des

puis
ce
maréchal
avait
une
sale
tête

doutait
encore
lorsque

il
était
très
pâle

heures
le

formidable
cette
classique
soirée
de
folie

toute
la
jeunesse
galante
un
beau
monde
se
ruant
dans
une
brutalité
et
une
imbécillité
de
laquais
sécrasait
sous
les
guirlandes
de
gaz
des

noirs
des

excessives
des
femmes
venues
décolletées
avec
de

par

sans

à

sept
femmes
enfermées
dans
le
vestiaire
pleuraient
pour
quon
les
délivrât
une
échalote
trouvée
et
mise
aux

poussée
jusqu
à
deux
louis

nana
arrivait
encore
vêtue
de
sa
toilette
de

bleue
et
blanche
lui
donna
léchalote
au
milieu
dun
tonnerre
de
bravos
lempoigna
malgré
elle
trois
messieurs
la
portèrent
en
triomphe
dans
le
jardin
à

les
pelouses
saccagées
les
massifs
de

éventrés
et
comme

le
prit

et
les

une
police
paternelle
organisait
le
désordre
ce
fut
seulement
le
mardi
que
nana
se
remit
des
émotions
de
sa
victoire
elle
causait
le
matin
avec
madame
lerat
venue
pour
lui
donner
des
nouvelles
de
louiset
que
le
grand
air
avait
rendu
malade
toute
une
histoire
qui
occupait
paris
la
passionnait
vandeuvres
exclu
des
champs
de
courses
exécuté
le
soir
même
au
cercle
impérial
sétait
le
lendemain
fait
flamber
dans
son
écurie
avec
ses
chevaux
il
lavait
bien
dit
répétait
la
jeune
femme
un
vrai
fou
cet
hommelà
cest
moi
qui
ai
eu
une
venette
lorsquon
raconté
ça
hier
soir
tu
comprends
il
aurait
très
bien
pu
massassiner
une
nuit
et
puis
estce
quil
ne
devait
pas
prévenir
pour
son
cheval
jaurais
fait
fortune
au
moins
il
dit
à
labordette
que
si
je
savais
laffaire
je
renseignerais
tout
de
suite
mon
coiffeur
et
un
tas
dhommes
comme
cest
poli
ah
non
vrai
je
ne
peux
pas
le
regretter
beaucoup
après
réflexion
elle
était
devenue
furieuse
justement
labordette
entra
il
avait
réglé
ses
paris
il
lui
apportait
une
quarantaine
de
mille
francs
cela
ne
fit
quaugmenter
sa
mauvaise
humeur
car
elle
aurait
dû
gagner
un
million
labordette
qui
faisait
linnocent
dans
toute
cette
aventure
abandonnait
carrément
vandeuvres
ces
anciennes
familles
étaient
vidées
elles
finissaient
dune
façon
bête
eh
non
dit
nana
ce
nest
pas
bête
de
sallumer
comme
ça
dans
une
écurie
moi
je
trouve
quil
fini
crânement
oh
tu
sais
je
ne
défends
pas
son
histoire
avec
maréchal
cest
imbécile
quand
je
pense
que
blanche
eu
le
toupet
de
vouloir
mettre
ça
sur
le
dos
jai
répondu
estce
que
je
lui
ai
dit
de
voler
nestce
pas
peut
demander
de
largent
à
un
homme
sans
le
pousser
au
crime
sil
mavait
dit
je
nai
plus
rien
je
lui
aurais
dit
cest
bon
quittonsnous
et
ça
ne
serait
pas
allé
plus
loin
sans
doute
dit
la
tante
gravement
lorsque
les
hommes
sobstinent
tant
pis
pour
eux
mais
quant
à
la
petite
fête
de
la
fin
oh
très
chic
reprit
nana
il
paraît
que
ç
été
terrible
à
vous
donner
la
chair
de
poule
il
avait
écarté
tout
le
monde
il
sétait
enfermé
làdedans
avec
du
pétrole
et
ça
brûlait
fallait
voir
pensez
donc
une
grande
machine
presque
toute
en
bois
pleine
de
paille
et
de
foin
les
flammes
montaient
comme
des
tours
le
plus
beau
cétaient
les
chevaux
qui
ne
voulaient
pas
rôtir
les
entendait
qui
ruaient
qui
se
jetaient
dans
les
portes
qui
poussaient
de
vrais
cris
de
personne
oui
des
gens
en
ont
gardé
la
petite
mort
sur
la
peau
labordette
laissa
échapper
un
léger
souffle
dincrédulité
lui
ne
croyait
pas
à
la
mort
de
vandeuvres
quelquun
jurait
lavoir
vu
se
sauver
par
une
fenêtre
il
avait
allumé
son
écurie
dans
un
détraquement
de
cervelle
seulement
dès
que
ça
sétait
mis
à
chauffer
trop
fort
ça
devait
lavoir
dégrisé
un
homme
si
bête
avec
les
femmes
si
vidé
ne
pouvait
pas
mourir
avec
cette
crânerie
nana
lécoutait
désillusionnée
et
elle
ne
trouva
que
cette
phrase
oh
le
malheureux
cétait
si
beau
xii
vers
une
heure
du
matin
dans
le
grand
lit
drapé
de
point
de
venise
nana
et
le
comte
ne
dormaient
pas
encore
il
était
revenu
le
soir
après
une
bouderie
de
trois
jours
la
chambre
faiblement
éclairée
par
une
lampe
sommeillait
chaude
et
toute
moite
dune
odeur
damour
avec
les
pâleurs
vagues
de
ses
meubles
de
laque
blanche
incrustée
dargent
un
rideau
rabattu
noyait
le
lit
dun
flot
dombre
il
eut
un
soupir
puis
un
baiser
coupa
le
silence
et
nana
glissant
des
couvertures
resta
un
instant
assise
au
bord
des
draps
les
jambes
nues
le
comte
la
tête
retombée
sur
loreiller
demeurait
dans
le
noir
chéri
tu
crois
au
bon
dieu
demandatelle
après
un
moment
de
réflexion
la
face
grave
envahie
dune
épouvante
religieuse
au
sortir
des
bras
de
son
amant
depuis
le
matin
elle
se
plaignait
dun
malaise
et
toutes
ses
idées
bêtes
comme
elle
disait
des
idées
de
mort
et
denfer
la
travaillaient
sourdement
cétait
parfois
chez
elle
des
nuits
où
des
peurs
denfant
des
imaginations
atroces
la
secouaient
de
cauchemars
les
yeux
ouverts
elle
reprit
hein
pensestu
que
jirai
au
ciel
et
elle
avait
un
frisson
tandis
que
le
comte
surpris
de
ces
questions
singulières
en
un
pareil
moment
sentait
séveiller
ses
remords
de
catholique
mais
la
chemise
glissée
des
épaules
les
cheveux
dénoués
elle
se
rabattit
sur
sa
poitrine
en
sanglotant
en
se
cramponnant
jai
peur
de
mourir
jai
peur
de
mourir
il
eut
toutes
les
peines
du
monde
à
se
dégager
luimême
craignait
de
céder
au
coup
de
folie
de
cette
femme
collée
contre
son
corps
dans
leffroi
contagieux
de
linvisible
et
il
la
raisonnait
elle
se
portait
parfaitement
elle
devait
simplement
se
bien
conduire
pour
mériter
un
jour
le
pardon
mais
elle
hochait
la
tête
sans
doute
elle
ne
faisait
de
mal
à
personne
même
elle
portait
toujours
une
médaille
de
la
vierge
quelle
lui
montra
pendue
à
un
fil
rouge
entre
les
seins
seulement
cétait
réglé
davance
toutes
les
femmes
qui
nétaient
pas
mariées
et
qui
voyaient
des
hommes
allaient
en
enfer
des
lambeaux
de
son
catéchisme
lui
revenaient
ah
si
lon
avait
su
au
juste
mais
voilà
ne
savait
rien
personne
ne
rapportait
des
nouvelles
et
vrai
ce
serait
stupide
de
se
gêner
si
les
prêtres
disaient
des
bêtises
pourtant
elle
baisait
dévotement
la
médaille
toute
tiède
de
sa
peau
comme
une
conjuration
contre
la
mort
dont
lidée
lemplissait
dune
horreur
froide
il
fallut
que
muffat
laccompagnât
dans
le
cabinet
de
toilette
elle
tremblait
rester
une
minute
seule
même
en
laissant
la
porte
ouverte
quand
il
se
fut
recouché
elle
rôda
encore
par
la
chambre
visitant
les
coins
tressaillant
au
plus
léger
bruit
une
glace
larrêta
elle
soublia
comme
autrefois
dans
le
spectacle
de
sa
nudité
mais
la
vue
de
sa
gorge
de
ses
hanches
et
de
ses
cuisses
redoublait
sa
peur
elle
finit
par
se
tâter
les
os
de
la
face
longuement
avec
les
deux
mains
est
laid
quand
est
mort
ditelle
dune
voix
lente
et
elle
se
serrait
les
joues
elle
sagrandissait
les
yeux
senfonçait
la
mâchoire
pour
voir
comment
elle
serait
puis
se
tournant
vers
le
comte
ainsi
défigurée
regarde
donc
jaurai
la
tête
toute
petite
moi
alors
il
se
fâcha
tu
es
folle
viens
te
coucher
il
la
voyait
dans
une
fosse
avec
le
décharnement
dun
siècle
de
sommeil
et
ses
mains
sétaient
jointes
il
bégayait
une
prière
depuis
quelque
temps
la
religion
lavait
reconquis
ses
crises
de
foi
chaque
jour
reprenaient
cette
violence
de
coups
de
sang
qui
le
laissaient
comme
assommé
les
doigts
de
ses
mains
craquaient
il
répétait
ces
seuls
mots
continuellement
mon
dieu
mon
dieu
mon
dieu
cétait
le
cri
de
son
impuissance
le
cri
de
son
péché
contre
lequel
il
restait
sans
force
malgré
la
certitude
de
sa
damnation
quand
elle
revint
elle
le
trouva
sous
la
couverture
hagard
les
ongles
dans
la
poitrine
les
yeux
en
lair
comme
pour
chercher
le
ciel
et
elle
se
remit
à
pleurer
tous
deux
sembrassèrent
claquant
des
dents
sans
savoir
pourquoi
roulant
au
fond
de
la
même
obsession
imbécile
ils
avaient
déjà
passé
une
nuit
semblable
seulement
cette
fois
cétait
complètement
idiot
ainsi
que
nana
le
déclara
lorsquelle
neut
plus
peur
un
soupçon
lui
fit
interroger
le
comte
avec
prudence
peutêtre
rose
mignon
avaitelle
envoyé
la
fameuse
lettre
mais
ce
nétait
pas
ça
cétait
le
trac
pas
davantage
car
il
ignorait
encore
son
cocuage
deux
jours
plus
tard
après
une
nouvelle
disparition
muffat
se
présenta
dans
la
matinée
heure
à
laquelle
il
ne
venait
jamais
il
était
livide
les
yeux
rougis
tout
secoué
encore
dune
grande
lutte
intérieure
mais
zoé
effarée
ellemême
ne
saperçut
pas
de
son
trouble
elle
avait
couru
à
sa
rencontre
elle
lui
criait
oh
monsieur
arrivez
donc
madame
failli
mourir
hier
soir
et
comme
il
demandait
des
détails
quelque
chose
à
ne
pas
croire
une
fausse
couche
monsieur
nana
était
enceinte
de
trois
mois
longtemps
elle
avait
cru
à
une
indisposition
le
docteur
boutarel
luimême
doutait
puis
quand
il
se
prononça
nettement
elle
éprouva
un
tel
ennui
quelle
fit
tout
au
monde
pour
dissimuler
sa
grossesse
ses
peurs
nerveuses
ses
humeurs
noires
venaient
un
peu
de
cette
aventure
dont
elle
gardait
le
secret
avec
une
honte
de
fillemère
forcée
de
cacher
son
état
cela
lui
semblait
un
accident
ridicule
quelque
chose
qui
la
diminuait
et
dont
laurait
plaisantée
hein
la
mauvaise
blague
pas
de
veine
vraiment
il
fallait
quelle
fût
pincée
quand
elle
croyait
que
cétait
fini
et
elle
avait
une
continuelle
surprise
comme
dérangée
dans
son
sexe
ça
faisait
donc
des
enfants
même
lorsquon
ne
voulait
plus
et
quon
employait
ça
à
dautres
affaires
la
nature
lexaspérait
cette
maternité
grave
qui
se
levait
dans
son
plaisir
cette
vie
donnée
au
milieu
de
toutes
les
morts
quelle
semait
autour
delle
estce
quon
naurait
pas
dû
disposer
de
soi
à
sa
fantaisie
sans
tant
dhistoires
ainsi
doù
tombaitil
ce
mioche
elle
ne
pouvait
seulement
le
dire
ah
dieu
celui
qui
lavait
fait
aurait
eu
une
riche
idée
en
le
gardant
pour
lui
car
personne
ne
le
réclamait
il
gênait
tout
le
monde
et
il
naurait
bien
sûr
pas
beaucoup
de
bonheur
dans
lexistence
cependant
zoé
racontait
la
catastrophe
madame
été
prise
de
coliques
vers
quatre
heures
quand
je
suis
allée
dans
le
cabinet
de
toilette
ne
la
voyant
plus
revenir
je
lai
trouvée
étendue
par
terre
évanouie
oui
monsieur
par
terre
dans
une
mare
de
sang
comme
si
lavait
assassinée
alors
jai
compris
nestce
pas
jétais
furieuse
madame
aurait
bien
pu
confier
son
malheur
justement
il
avait
là
monsieur
georges
il
aidée
à
la
relever
et
au
premier
mot
de
fausse
couche
voilà
quil
sest
trouvé
mal
à
son
tour
vrai
je
fais
de
la
bile
depuis
hier
en
effet
lhôtel
paraissait
bouleversé
tous
les
domestiques
galopaient
à
travers
lescalier
et
les
pièces
georges
venait
de
passer
la
nuit
sur
un
fauteuil
du
salon
cétait
lui
qui
avait
annoncé
la
nouvelle
aux
amis
de
madame
le
soir
à
lheure
où
madame
recevait
dhabitude
il
restait
très
pâle
il
racontait
lhistoire
plein
de
stupeur
et
démotion
steiner
la
faloise
philippe
dautres
encore
sétaient
présentés
dès
la
première
phrase
ils
poussaient
une
exclamation
pas
possible
ça
devait
être
une
farce
ensuite
ils
devenaient
sérieux
ils
regardaient
la
porte
de
la
chambre
lair
ennuyé
hochant
la
tête
ne
trouvant
pas
ça
drôle
jusqu
à
minuit
une
douzaine
de
messieurs
avaient
causé
bas
devant
la
cheminée
tous
amis
tous
travaillés
par
la
même
idée
de
paternité
ils
semblaient
sexcuser
entre
eux
avec
des
mines
confuses
de
maladroits
puis
ils
arrondissaient
le
dos
ça
ne
les
regardait
pas
ça
venait
delle
hein
épatante
cette
nana
jamais
naurait
cru
à
une
pareille
blague
de
sa
part
et
ils
sen
étaient
allés
un
à
un
sur
la
pointe
des
pieds
comme
dans
la
chambre
dun
mort
où
lon
ne
peut
plus
rire
montez
tout
de
même
monsieur
dit
zoé
à
muffat
madame
est
beaucoup
mieux
elle
va
vous
recevoir
nous
attendons
le
docteur
qui
promis
de
revenir
ce
matin
la
femme
de
chambre
avait
décidé
georges
à
retourner
chez
lui
pour
dormir
en
haut
dans
le
salon
il
ne
restait
que
satin
allongée
sur
un
divan
fumant
une
cigarette
les
yeux
en
lair
depuis
laccident
au
milieu
de
leffarement
de
lhôtel
elle
montrait
une
rage
froide
avec
des
haussements
dépaules
des
mots
féroces
alors
comme
zoé
passait
devant
elle
en
répétant
à
monsieur
que
cette
pauvre
madame
avait
beaucoup
souffert
cest
bien
fait
ça
lui
apprendra
lâchatelle
dune
voix
brève
ils
se
retournèrent
surpris
satin
navait
pas
remué
les
yeux
toujours
au
plafond
sa
cigarette
pincée
nerveusement
entre
ses
lèvres
eh
bien
vous
êtes
bonne
vous
dit
zoé
mais
satin
se
mit
sur
son
séant
regarda
furieusement
le
comte
en
lui
plantant
de
nouveau
sa
phrase
dans
la
face
cest
bien
fait
ça
lui
apprendra
et
elle
se
recoucha
souffla
un
mince
jet
de
fumée
comme
désintéressée
et
résolue
à
ne
se
mêler
de
rien
non
cétait
trop
bête
zoé
pourtant
venait
dintroduire
muffat
dans
la
chambre
une
odeur
déther
traînait
au
milieu
dun
silence
tiède
que
les
rares
voitures
de
lavenue
de
villiers
troublaient
à
peine
dun
sourd
roulement
nana
très
blanche
sur
loreiller
ne
dormait
pas
les
yeux
grands
ouverts
et
songeurs
elle
sourit
sans
bouger
en
apercevant
le
comte
ah
mon
chat
murmuratelle
dune
voix
lente
jai
bien
cru
que
je
ne
te
reverrais
jamais
puis
quand
il
se
pencha
pour
la
baiser
sur
les
cheveux
elle
sattendrit
elle
lui
parla
de
lenfant
de
bonne
foi
comme
sil
en
était
le
père
je
nosais
pas
te
dire
je
sentais
si
heureuse
oh
je
faisais
des
rêves
jaurais
voulu
quil
fût
digne
de
toi
et
voilà
il
n
plus
rien
enfin
ça
vaut
mieux
peutêtre
je
nentends
pas
mettre
un
embarras
dans
ta
vie
lui
étonné
de
cette
paternité
balbutiait
des
phrases
il
avait
pris
une
chaise
et
sétait
assis
contre
le
lit
un
bras
appuyé
aux
couvertures
alors
la
jeune
femme
remarqua
son
visage
bouleversé
le
sang
qui
rougissait
ses
yeux
la
fièvre
dont
tremblaient
ses
lèvres
quastu
donc
demandatelle
tu
es
malade
toi
aussi
non
ditil
péniblement
elle
le
regarda
dun
air
profond
puis
dun
signe
elle
renvoya
zoé
qui
sattardait
à
ranger
les
fioles
et
quand
ils
furent
seuls
elle
lattira
en
répétant
quastu
chéri
tes
yeux
crèvent
de
larmes
je
le
vois
bien
allons
parle
tu
es
venu
pour
dire
quelque
chose
non
non
je
te
jure
bégayatil
mais
étranglé
de
souffrance
attendri
encore
par
cette
chambre
de
malade
où
il
tombait
sans
savoir
il
éclata
en
sanglots
il
enfouit
son
visage
dans
les
draps
pour
étouffer
lexplosion
de
sa
douleur
nana
avait
compris
bien
sûr
rose
mignon
sétait
décidée
à
envoyer
la
lettre
elle
le
laissa
pleurer
un
instant
secoué
de
convulsions
si
rudes
quil
la
remuait
dans
le
lit
enfin
dun
accent
de
maternelle
compassion
tu
eu
des
ennuis
chez
toi
il
dit
oui
de
la
tête
elle
fit
une
nouvelle
pause
puis
très
bas
alors
tu
sais
tout
il
dit
oui
de
la
tête
et
le
silence
retomba
un
lourd
silence
dans
la
chambre
endolorie
cétait
la
veille
en
rentrant
dune
soirée
chez
limpératrice
quil
avait
reçu
la
lettre
écrite
par
sabine
à
son
amant
après
une
nuit
atroce
passée
à
rêver
de
vengeance
il
était
sorti
le
matin
pour
résister
au
besoin
de
tuer
sa
femme
dehors
saisi
par
la
douceur
dune
belle
matinée
de
juin
il
navait
plus
retrouvé
ses
idées
il
était
venu
chez
nana
comme
il
venait
à
toutes
les
heures
terribles
de
son
existence
là
seulement
il
sabandonnait
dans
sa
misère
avec
la
joie
lâche
dêtre
consolé
voyons
calmetoi
reprit
la
jeune
femme
en
se
faisant
très
bonne
il
longtemps
que
je
le
sais
mais
bien
sûr
ce
nest
pas
moi
qui
taurais
ouvert
les
yeux
tu
te
rappelles
lannée
dernière
tu
avais
eu
des
doutes
puis
grâce
à
prudence
les
choses
sétaient
arrangées
enfin
tu
manquais
de
preuves
dame
aujourdhui
si
tu
en
une
cest
dur
je
le
comprends
pourtant
il
faut
se
faire
une
raison
nest
pas
déshonoré
pour
ça
il
ne
pleurait
plus
une
honte
le
tenait
bien
quil
eût
glissé
depuis
longtemps
aux
confidences
les
plus
intimes
sur
son
ménage
elle
dut
lencourager
voyons
elle
était
femme
elle
pouvait
tout
entendre
comme
il
laissait
échapper
dune
voix
sourde
tu
es
malade
quoi
bon
te
fatiguer
cest
stupide
dêtre
venu
je
men
vais
mais
non
ditelle
vivement

je
te
donnerai
peutêtre
un
bon
conseil
seulement
ne
fais
pas
trop
parler
le
médecin
l
défendu
il
sétait
enfin
levé
il
marchait
dans
la
chambre
alors
elle
le
questionna
maintenant
que
vastu
faire
je
vais
souffleter
cet
homme
parbleu
elle
eut
une
moue
de
désapprobation
ça
ce
nest
pas
fort
et
ta
femme
je
plaiderai
jai
une
preuve
pas
fort
du
tout
mon
cher
cest
même
bête
tu
sais
jamais
je
ne
te
laisserai
faire
ça
et
posément
de
sa
voix
faible
elle
démontra
le
scandale
inutile
dun
duel
et
dun
procès
pendant
huit
jours
il
serait
la
fable
des
journaux
cétait
son
existence
entière
quil
jouerait
sa
tranquillité
sa
haute
situation
à
la
cour
lhonneur
de
son
nom
et
pourquoi
pour
mettre
les
rieurs
contre
lui
quimporte
criatil
je
serai
vengé
mon
chat
ditelle
quand
ne
se
venge
pas
tout
de
suite
dans
ces
machineslà
ne
se
venge
jamais
il
sarrêta
balbutiant
certes
il
nétait
pas
lâche
mais
il
sentait
quelle
avait
raison
un
malaise
grandissait
en
lui
quelque
chose
dappauvri
et
de
honteux
qui
venait
de
lamollir
dans
lélan
de
sa
colère
dailleurs
elle
lui
porta
un
nouveau
coup
avec
une
franchise
décidée
à
tout
dire
et
veuxtu
savoir
ce
qui
tembête
chéri
cest
que
toimême
tu
trompes
ta

pas
pour

des
perles

sen
douter
alors

reproche

elle
te
répondra
que

qui

fermera
le
bec
voilà
chéri
pourquoi
tu

ici
à
piétiner
au
lieu

làbas
à
les
massacrer
tous
les
deux
muffat
était
retombé
sur
la
chaise
accablé
sous
cette
brutalité
de
paroles
elle
se
tut
reprenant
haleine
puis
à
demivoix
oh
je
suis
brisée
aidemoi
donc
à
relever
un
peu
je
glisse
toujours
jai
la
tête
trop
basse
quand
il
leut
aidée
elle
soupira
se
trouvant
mieux
et
elle
revint
sur
le
beau
spectacle
dun
procès
en
séparation
voyaitil
lavocat
de
la
comtesse
amuser
paris
en
parlant
de
nana
tout
aurait
passé
son
four
aux
variétés
son
hôtel
sa
vie
ah
non
par
exemple
elle
ne
tenait
pas
à
tant
de
réclame
de
sales
femmes
lauraient
peutêtre
poussé
pour
battre
la
grosse
caisse
sur
son
dos
mais
elle
avant
tout
voulait
son
bonheur
elle
lavait
attiré
elle
le
tenait
maintenant
la
tête
au
bord
de
loreiller
près
de
la
sienne
un
bras
passé
à
son
cou
et
elle
lui
souffla
doucement
écoute
mon
chat
tu
vas
te
remettre
avec
ta
femme
il
se
révolta
jamais
son
coeur
éclatait
cétait
trop
de
honte
elle
pourtant
insistait
avec
tendresse
tu
vas
te
remettre
avec
ta
femme
voyons
tu
ne
veux
pas
entendre
dire
partout
que
je
tai
détourné
de
ton
ménage
ça
ferait
une
trop
vilaine
réputation
que
penseraiton
de
moi
seulement
jure
que
tu
maimeras
toujours
parce
que
du
moment
où
tu
iras
avec
une
autre
les
larmes
la
suffoquaient
il
linterrompit
par
des
baisers
en
répétant
tu
es
folle
cest
impossible
si
si
repritelle
il
le
faut
je
ferai
une
raison
après
tout
elle
est
ta
femme
ce
nest
pas
comme
si
tu
trompais
avec
la
première
venue
et
elle
continua
ainsi
lui
donnant
les
meilleurs
conseils
même
elle
parla
de
dieu
il
croyait
entendre
venot
quand
le
vieillard
le
sermonnait
pour
larracher
au
péché
elle
cependant
ne
parlait
pas
de
rompre
elle
prêchait
des
complaisances
un
partage
de
bonhomme
entre
sa
femme
et
sa
maîtresse
une
vie
de
tranquillité
sans
embêtement
pour
personne
quelque
chose
comme
un
heureux
sommeil
dans
les
saletés
inévitables
de
lexistence
ça
ne
changerait
rien
à
leur
vie
il
resterait
son
petit
chat
préféré
seulement
il
viendrait
un
peu
moins
souvent
et
donnerait
à
la
comtesse
les
nuits
quil
ne
passerait
pas
avec
elle
elle
était
à
bout
de
forces
elle
acheva
dans
un
petit
souffle
enfin
jaurai
la
conscience
davoir
fait
une
bonne
action
tu
maimeras
davantage
un
silence
régna
elle
avait
fermé
les
yeux
pâlissant
encore
sur
loreiller
maintenant
il
lécoutait
sous
le
prétexte
quil
ne
voulait
pas
la
fatiguer
au
bout
dune
grande
minute
elle
rouvrit
les
yeux
elle
murmura
et
largent
dailleurs
où
prendrastu
largent
si
tu
te
fâches
labordette
est
venu
hier
pour
le
billet
moi
je
manque
de
tout
je
nai
plus
rien
à
mettre
sur
le
corps
puis
refermant
les
paupières
elle
parut
morte
une
ombre
dangoisse
profonde
avait
passé
sur
le
visage
de
muffat
dans
le
coup
qui
le
frappait
il
oubliait
depuis
la
veille
des
embarras
dargent
dont
il
ne
savait
comment
sortir
malgré
des
promesses
formelles
le
billet
de
cent
mille
francs
renouvelé
une
première
fois
venait
dêtre
mis
en
circulation
et
labordette
affectant
le
désespoir
rejetait
tout
sur
francis
disait
quil
ne
lui
arriverait
plus
de
se
compromettre
dans
une
affaire
avec
un
homme
de
peu
déducation
il
fallait
payer
jamais
le
comte
naurait
laissé
protester
sa
signature
puis
outre
les
nouvelles
exigences
de
nana
cétait
chez
lui
un
gâchis
de
dépenses
extraordinaires
au
retour
des
fondettes
la
comtesse
avait
brusquement
montré
un
goût
de
luxe
un
appétit
de
jouissances
mondaines
qui
dévoraient
leur
fortune
commençait
à
parler
de
ses
caprices
ruineux
tout
un
nouveau
train
de
maison
cinq
cent
mille
francs
gaspillés
à
transformer
le
vieil
hôtel
de
la
rue
miromesnil
et
des
toilettes
excessives
et
des
sommes
considérables
disparues
fondues
données
peutêtre
sans
quelle
se
souciât
den
rendre
compte
deux
fois
muffat
sétait
permis
des
observations
voulant
savoir
mais
elle
lavait
regardé
dun
air
si
singulier
en
souriant
quil
nosait
plus
linterroger
de
peur
dune
réponse
trop
nette
sil
acceptait
daguenet
comme
gendre
de
la
main
de
nana
cétait
surtout
avec
lidée
de
pouvoir
réduire
la
dot
destelle
à
deux
cent
mille
francs
quitte
à
prendre
pour
le
reste
des
arrangements
avec
le
jeune
homme
heureux
encore
de
ce
mariage
inespéré
cependant
depuis
huit
jours
dans
cette
nécessité
immédiate
de
trouver
les
cent
mille
francs
de
labordette
muffat
avait
imaginé
un
seul
expédient
devant
lequel
il
reculait
cétait
de
vendre
les
bordes
une
magnifique
propriété
estimée
à
un
demimillion
quun
oncle
venait
de
léguer
à
la
comtesse
seulement
il
fallait
la
signature
de
celleci
qui
ellemême
par
son
contrat
ne
pouvait
aliéner
la
propriété
sans
lautorisation
du
comte
la
veille
enfin
il
avait
résolu
de
causer
de
cette
signature
avec
sa
femme
et
tout
croulait
jamais
à
cette
heure
il
naccepterait
un
pareil
compromis
cette
pensée
enfonçait
davantage
le
coup
affreux
de
ladultère
il
comprenait
bien
ce
que
nana
demandait
car
dans
labandon
croissant
qui
le
poussait
à
la
mettre
de
moitié
en
tout
il
sétait
plaint
de
sa
situation
il
lui
avait
confié
son
ennui
au
sujet
de
cette
signature
de
la
comtesse
pourtant
nana
ne
parut
pas
insister
elle
ne
rouvrait
plus
les
yeux
en
la
voyant
si
pâle
il
eut
peur
il
lui
fit
prendre
un
peu
déther
et
elle
soupira
elle
le
questionna
sans
nommer
daguenet
quand
le
mariage
signe
le
contrat
mardi
dans
cinq
jours
réponditil
alors
les
paupières
toujours
closes
comme
si
elle
parlait
dans
la
nuit
de
ses
pensées
enfin
mon
chat
vois
ce
que
tu
à
faire
moi
je
veux
que
tout
le
monde
soit
content
il
la
calma
en
lui
prenant
une
main
oui
lon
verrait
limportant
était
quelle
se
reposât
et
il
ne
se
révoltait
plus
cette
chambre
de
malade
si
tiède
et
si
endormie
trempée

avait
achevé
de
lassoupir
dans
un
besoin
de
paix
heureuse
toute
sa
virilité
enragée
par
linjure

était
allée
à
la
chaleur
de
ce
lit
près
de
cette
femme
souffrante
quil
soignait
avec
lexcitation
de
sa
fièvre
et
le
ressouvenir
de
leurs
voluptés
il
se
penchait
vers
elle
il
la
serrait
dans
une
étreinte
tandis
que
la
figure
immobile
elle
avait
aux
lèvres
un
fin
sourire
de
victoire
mais
le
docteur
boutarel
parut
eh
bien
et

chère
enfant

un
bel
homme
jeune
encore
qui
avait
une
clientèle
superbe
dans
le
monde
galant
très
gai
riant
en
camarade
avec
ces
dames
mais
ne
couchant
jamais
il
se
faisait
payer
fort
cher
et
avec
la
plus
grande
exactitude
dailleurs
il
se
dérangeait
au
moindre
appel
nana

chercher
deux
ou
trois
fois
par

toujours
tremblante
à
lidée
de

en

de

cette
fois
le
bobo
était
sérieux

retirait
très
ému
il
néprouvait

quun
attendrissement
à
voir
sa
pauvre
nana
si
faible
comme
il
sortait
elle
le
rappela
dun
signe
elle
lui
tendit
le
front
et
à
voix
basse
dun
air
de
menace
plaisante
tu
sais
ce
que
je
tai
permis
retourne
avec
ta
femme
ou
plus
rien
je
fâche
la
comtesse
sabine
avait
voulu
que
le
contrat
de
sa
fille
fût
signé
un
mardi
pour
inaugurer
par
une
fête
lhôtel
restauré
où
les
peintures
séchaient
à
peine
cinq
cents
invitations
étaient
lancées
un
peu
dans
tous
les
mondes
le
matin
encore
les
tapissiers
clouaient
des
tentures
et
au
moment
dallumer
les
lustres
vers
neuf
heures
larchitecte
accompagné
de
la
comtesse
qui
se
passionnait
donnait
les
derniers
ordres
cétait
une
de
ces
fêtes
de
printemps
dun
charme
si
tendre
les
chaudes
soirées
de
juin
avaient
permis
douvrir
les
deux
portes
du
grand
salon
et
de
prolonger
le
bal
jusque
sur
le
sable
du
jardin
quand
les
premiers
invités
arrivèrent
accueillis
à
la
porte
par
le
comte
et
la
comtesse
ils
eurent
un
éblouissement
il
fallait
se
rappeler
le
salon
dautrefois
où
passait
le
souvenir
glacial
de
la
comtesse
muffat
cette
pièce
antique
toute
pleine
dune
sévérité
dévote
avec
son
meuble
empire
dacajou
massif
ses
tentures
de
velours
jaune
son
plafond
verdâtre
trempé
dhumidité
maintenant
dès
lentrée
dans
le
vestibule
des
mosaïques
rehaussées
dor
se
moiraient
sous
de
hauts
candélabres
tandis
que
lescalier
de
marbre
déroulait
sa
rampe
aux
fines
ciselures
puis
le
salon
resplendissait
drapé
de
velours
de
gênes
tendu
au
plafond
dune
vaste
décoration
de
boucher
que
larchitecte
avait
payée
cent
mille
francs
à
la
vente
du
château
de

les
lustres
les
appliques
de
cristal
allumaient
là
un
luxe
de
glaces
et
de
meubles
précieux
eût
dit
que
la
chaise
longue
de
sabine
ce
siège
unique
de
soie
rouge
dont
la
mollesse
autrefois
étonnait
sétait
multipliée
élargie
jusqu
à
emplir
lhôtel
entier
dune
voluptueuse
paresse
dune
jouissance
aiguë
qui
brûlait
avec
la
violence
des
feux
tardifs
déjà
lon
dansait
lorchestre
placé
dans
le
jardin
devant
une
des
fenêtres
ouvertes
jouait
une
valse
dont
le
rythme
souple
arrivait
adouci
envolé
au
plein
air
et
le
jardin
sélargissait
dans
une
ombre
transparente
éclairé
de
lanternes
vénitiennes
avec
une
tente
de
pourpre
plantée
sur
le
bord
dune
pelouse
où
était
installé
un
buffet
cette
valse
justement
la
valse
canaille
de
la
blonde
vénus
qui
avait
le
rire
dune
polissonnerie
pénétrait
le
vieil
hôtel
dune
onde
sonore
dun
frisson
chauffant
les
murs
il
semblait
que
ce
fût
quelque
vent
de
la
chair
venu
de
la
rue
balayant
tout
un
âge
mort
dans
la
hautaine
demeure
emportant
le
passé
des
muffat
un
siècle
dhonneur
et
de
foi
endormi
sous
les
plafonds

près
de
la
cheminée
à
leur
place
habituelle
les
vieux
amis
de
la
mère
du
comte
se
réfugiaient
dépaysés
éblouis
ils
formaient
un
petit
groupe
au
milieu
de
la
cohue
peu
à
peu
envahissante
madame
du
joncquoy
ne
reconnaissant
plus
les
pièces
avait
traversé
la
salle
à

madame

regardait
dun
air
stupéfait
le
jardin
qui
lui
paraissait
immense
bientôt
à
voix
basse
ce
fut
dans
ce
coin
toutes
sortes
de
réflexions
amères

madame

si

de

pour

dun
point

triomphante
de

avec
une
pointe
divresse
dans
son
continuel
sourire

peu
pâle

aussi
de
son
air
calme
et
digne
et

madame
chantereau
que

un
petit
banc

serait
entré
sans
quil

permis
ah

se
turent
madame

suivie
dune
bande
de
jeunes
messieurs
sextasiant
approuvant
avec
de
légères
exclamations
oh
délicieux
exquis
cest
dun
goût
et
elle
leur
jeta
de
loin
que

n
rien
comme
ces
vieilles
masures
lorsquon
les
arrange
ça
vous

un
chic
nestce
pas
tout
à
fait
grand
siècle
enfin
elle
peut
recevoir
les
deux
vieilles
dames
sétaient
assises
de
nouveau
baissant
la
voix
causant
du
mariage
qui
étonnait
bien
des
gens
estelle
venait
de
passer
en
robe
de
soie
rose
toujours
maigre
et
plate
avec
sa
face
muette
de
vierge
elle
avait
accepté
daguenet
paisiblement
elle
ne
témoignait
ni
joie
ni
tristesse
aussi
froide
aussi
blanche
que
les
soirs
dhiver
où
elle
mettait
des
bûches
au
feu
toute
cette
fête
donnée
pour
elle
ces
lumières
ces
fleurs
cette
musique
la
laissaient
sans
une
émotion
un
aventurier
disait
madame
du
joncquoy
moi
je
ne
lai
jamais
vu
prenez
garde
le
voici
murmura
madame
chantereau
daguenet
qui
avait
aperçu
madame
hugon
avec
ses
fils
sétait
empressé
de
lui
offrir
le
bras
et
il
riait
il
lui
témoignait
une
effusion
de
tendresse
comme
si
elle
eût
travaillé
pour
une
part
à
son
coup
de
fortune
je
vous
remercie
ditelle
en
sasseyant
près
de
la
cheminée
voyezvous
cest
mon
ancien
coin
vous
le
connaissez
demanda
madame
du
joncquoy
lorsque
daguenet
fut
parti
certainement
un
charmant
jeune
homme
georges
laime
beaucoup
oh
une
famille
des
plus
honorables
et
la
bonne
dame
le
défendit
contre
une
sourde
hostilité
quelle
sentait
son
père
très
estimé
de
louisphilippe
avait
occupé
jusqu
à
sa
mort
une
préfecture
lui
sétait
un
peu
dissipé
peutêtre
le
prétendait
ruiné
en
tout
cas
un
de
ses
oncles
un
grand
propriétaire
devait
lui
laisser
sa
fortune
mais
ces
dames
hochaient
la
tête
pendant
que
madame
hugon
gênée
ellemême
revenait
toujours
à
lhonorabilité
de
la
famille
elle
était
très
lasse
elle
se
plaignit
de
ses
jambes
depuis
un
mois
elle
habitait
sa
maison
de
la
rue
richelieu
pour
un
tas
daffaires
disaitelle
une
ombre
de
tristesse
voilait
son
maternel
sourire
nimporte
conclut
madame
chantereau
estelle
aurait
pu
prétendre
à
beaucoup
mieux
il
eut
une
fanfare
cétait
un
quadrille
le
monde
refluait
aux
deux
côtés
du
salon
pour
laisser
la
place
libre
des
robes
claires
passaient
se
mêlaient
au
milieu
des
taches
sombres
des
habits
tandis
que
la
grande
lumière
mettait
sur
la
houle
des
têtes
des
éclairs
de
bijoux
un
frémissement
de
plumes
blanches
une
floraison
de
lilas
et
de
roses
il
faisait
déjà
chaud
un
parfum
pénétrant
montait
de
ces
tulles
légers
de
ces
chiffonnages
de
satin
et
de
soie
où
les
épaules
nues
pâlissaient
sous
les
notes
vives
de
lorchestre
par
les
portes
ouvertes
au
fond
des
pièces
voisines
voyait
des
rangées
de
femmes
assises
avec
léclat
discret
de
leur
sourire
une
lueur
des
yeux
une
moue
de
la
bouche
que
battait
le
souffle
des
éventails
et
des
invités
arrivaient
toujours
un
valet
lançait
des
noms
tandis
que
lentement
au
milieu
des
groupes
des
messieurs
tâchaient
de
caser
des
dames
embarrassées
à
leurs
bras
se
haussant
cherchant
de
loin
un
fauteuil
libre
mais
lhôtel
semplissait
les
jupes
se
tassaient
avec
un
petit
bruit
il
avait
des
coins
où
une
nappe
de
dentelles
de
noeuds
de
poufs
bouchait
le
passage
dans
la
résignation
polie
de
toutes
faites
à
ces
cohues
éblouissantes
gardant
leur
grâce
cependant
au
fond
du
jardin
sous
la
lueur
rosée
des
lanternes
vénitiennes
des
couples
senfonçaient
échappés
à
létouffement
du
grand
salon
des
ombres
de
robes
filaient
au
bord
de
la
pelouse
comme
rythmées
par
la
musique
du
quadrille
qui
prenait
derrière
les
arbres
une
douceur
lointaine
steiner
venait
de
rencontrer
là
foucarmont
et
la
faloise
buvant
un
verre
de
champagne
devant
le
buffet
cest
pourri
de
chic
disait
la
faloise
en
examinant
la
tente
de
pourpre
tenue
sur
des
lances
dorées
se
croirait
à
la
foire
aux
pains
dépices
hein
cest
ça
la
foire
aux
pains
dépices
maintenant
il
affectait
une
blague
continuelle
posant
pour
le
jeune
homme
ayant
abusé
de
tout
et
ne
trouvant
plus
rien
digne
dêtre
pris
au
sérieux
cest
ce
pauvre
vandeuvres
qui
serait
surpris
sil
revenait
murmura
foucarmont
vous
vous
souvenez
quand
il
crevait
dennui
làbas
devant
la
cheminée
fichtre
il
ne
fallait
pas
rire
vandeuvres
laissez
donc
un
raté
reprit
dédaigneusement
la
faloise
en
voilà
un
qui
sest
mis
le
doigt
dans
loeil
sil
cru
nous
épater
avec
son
rôtissage
personne
nen
parle
seulement
plus
rasé
fini
enterré
vandeuvres
un
autre
puis
comme
steiner
leur
serrait
la
main
vous
savez
nana
vient
darriver
oh
une
entrée
mes
enfants
quelque
chose
de
pharamineux
dabord
elle
embrassé
la
comtesse
ensuite
quand
les
enfants
se
sont
approchés
elle
les
bénis
en
disant
à
daguenet
écoute
paul
si
tu
lui
fais
des
queues
cest
à
moi
que
tu
auras
à
faire
comment
vous
navez
pas
vu
ça
oh
un
chic
un
succès
les
deux
autres
lécoutaient
bouche
béante
enfin
ils
se
mirent
à
rire
lui
enchanté
se
trouvait
très
fort
hein
vous
avez
cru
que
cétait
arrivé
dame
puisque
cest
nana
qui
fait
le
mariage
dailleurs
elle
est
de
la
famille
les
fils
hugon
passaient
philippe
le
fit
taire
alors
entre
hommes
causa
du
mariage
georges
se
fâcha
contre
la
faloise
qui
racontait
lhistoire
nana
avait
bien
collé
à
muffat
un
de
ses
anciens
pour
gendre
seulement
il
était
faux
que
la
veille
encore
elle
eût
couché
avec
daguenet
foucarmont
se
permit
de
hausser
les
épaules
savaiton
jamais
quand
nana
couchait
avec
quelquun
mais
georges
emporté
répondit
par
un
moi
monsieur
je
le
sais
qui
les
mit
tous
en
gaieté
enfin
comme
le
dit
steiner
ça
faisait
toujours
une
drôle
de
cuisine
peu
à
peu
envahissait
le
buffet
ils
cédèrent
la
place
sans
se
quitter
la
faloise
regardait
les
femmes
effrontément
comme
sil
sétait
cru
à
mabille
au
fond
dune
allée
ce
fut
une
surprise
la
bande
trouva
venot
en
grande
conférence
avec
daguenet
et
des
plaisanteries
faciles
les
égayèrent
il
le
confessait
il
lui
donnait
des
conseils
pour
la
première
nuit
puis
ils
revinrent
devant
une
des
portes
du
salon
où
une
polka
emportait
des
couples
dans
un
balancement
qui
mettait
un
sillage
au
milieu
des
hommes
restés
debout
sous
les
souffles
venus
du
dehors
les
bougies
brûlaient
très
hautes
quand
une
robe
passait
avec
les
légers
claquements
de
la
cadence
elle
rafraîchissait
dun
petit
coup
de
vent
la
chaleur
braisillante
tombant
des
lustres
fichtre
ils
nont
pas
froid
là
dedans
murmura
la
faloise
leurs
yeux
clignaient
au
retour
des
ombres
mystérieuses
du
jardin
et
ils
se
montrèrent
le
marquis
de
chouard
isolé
dominant
de
sa
haute
taille
les
épaules
nues
qui
lentouraient
il
avait
une
face
pâle
très
sévère
un
air
de
hautaine
dignité
sous
sa
couronne
de
rares
cheveux
blancs
scandalisé
par
la
conduite
du
comte
muffat
il
venait
de
rompre
publiquement
il
affectait
de
ne
plus
mettre
les
pieds
dans
lhôtel
sil
avait
consenti
à
paraître
ce
soirlà
cétait
sur
les
instances
de
sa
petitefille
dont
il
désapprouvait
dailleurs
le
mariage
avec
des
paroles
indignées
contre
la
désorganisation
des
classes
dirigeantes
par
les
honteux
compromis
de
la
débauche
moderne
ah
cest
la
fin
disait
près
de
la
cheminée
madame
du
joncquoy
à
loreille
de
madame
chantereau
cette
fille
ensorcelé
ce
malheureux
nous
qui
lavons
connu
si
croyant
si
noble
il
paraît
quil
se
ruine
continua
madame
chantereau
mon
mari
eu
entre
les
mains
un
billet
il
vit
maintenant
dans
cet
hôtel
de
lavenue
de
villiers
tout
paris
en
cause
mon
dieu
je
nexcuse
pas
sabine
avouez
pourtant
quil
lui
donne
bien
des
sujets
de
plainte
et
dame
si
elle
jette
aussi
largent
par
les
fenêtres
elle
n
jette
pas
que
largent
interrompit
lautre
enfin
à
deux
ils
iront
plus
vite
une
noyade
dans
la
boue
chère
mais
une
voix
douce
les
interrompit
cétait
venot
il
était
venu
sasseoir
derrière
elles
comme
désireux
de
disparaître
et
se
penchant
il
murmurait
pourquoi
désespérer
dieu
se
manifeste
lorsque
tout
semble
perdu
lui
assistait
paisiblement
à
la
débâcle
de
cette
maison
quil
gouvernait
jadis
depuis
son
séjour
aux
fondettes
il
laissait
laffolement
grandir
avec
la
conscience
très
nette
de
son
impuissance
il
avait
tout
accepté
la
passion
enragée
du
comte
pour
nana
la
présence
de
fauchery
près
de
la
comtesse
même
le
mariage
destelle
et
de
daguenet
quimportaient
ces
choses
et
il
se
montrait
plus
souple
plus
mystérieux
nourrissant
lidée
de
semparer
du
jeune
ménage
comme
du
ménage
désuni
sachant
bien
que
les
grands
désordres
jettent
aux
grandes
dévotions
la
providence
aurait
son
heure
notre
ami
continuatil
à
voix
basse
est
toujours
animé
des
meilleurs
sentiments
religieux
il
men
donné
les
preuves
les
plus
douces
eh
bien
dit
madame
du
joncquoy
il
devrait
dabord
se
remettre
avec
sa
femme
sans
doute
justement
jai
lespoir
que
cette
réconciliation
ne
tardera
pas
alors
les
deux
vieilles
dames
le
questionnèrent
mais
il
redevint
très
humble
il
fallait
laisser
agir
le
ciel
tout
son
désir
en
rapprochant
le
comte
et
la
comtesse
était
déviter
un
scandale
public
la
religion
tolérait
bien
des
faiblesses
quand
gardait
les
convenances
enfin
reprit
madame
du
joncquoy
vous
auriez
dû
empêcher
ce
mariage
avec
cet
aventurier
le
petit
vieillard
avait
pris
un
air
de
profond
étonnement
vous
vous
trompez
monsieur
daguenet
est
un
jeune
homme
du
plus
grand
mérite
je
connais
ses
idées
il
veut
faire
oublier
des
erreurs
de
jeunesse
estelle
le
ramènera
soyezen
sûre
oh
estelle
murmura
dédaigneusement
madame
chantereau
je
crois
la
chère
petite
incapable
dune
volonté
elle
est
si
insignifiante
cette
opinion
fit
sourire
venot
dailleurs
il
ne
sexpliqua
pas
sur
la
jeune
mariée
fermant
les
paupières
comme
pour
se
désintéresser
il
se
perdit
de
nouveau
derrière
les
jupes
dans
son
coin
madame
hugon
au
milieu
de
sa
lassitude
distraite
avait
saisi
quelques
mots
elle
intervint
elle
conclut
de
son
air
de
tolérance
en
sadressant
au
marquis
de
chouard
qui
la
saluait
ces
dames
sont
trop
sévères
lexistence
est
si
mauvaise
pour
tout
le
monde
nestce
pas
mon
ami
doit
pardonner
beaucoup
aux
autres
lorsquon
veut
être
soimême
digne
de
pardon
le
marquis
resta
quelques
secondes
gêné
craignant
une
allusion
mais
la
bonne
dame
avait
un
si
triste
sourire
quil
se
remit
tout
de
suite
en
disant
non
pas
de
pardon
pour
certaines
fautes
cest
avec
ces
complaisances
quune
société
va
aux
abîmes
le
bal
sétait
encore
animé
un
nouveau
quadrille
donnait
au
plancher
du
salon
un
léger
balancement
comme
si
la
vieille
demeure
eût
fléchi
sous
le
branle
de
la
fête
par
moments
dans
la
pâleur
brouillée
des
têtes
se
détachait
un
visage
de
femme
emporté
par
la
danse
aux
yeux
brillants
aux
lèvres
entrouvertes
avec
le
coup
du
lustre
sur
la
peau
blanche
madame
du
joncquoy
déclarait
quil
n
avait
pas
de
bon
sens
cétait
une
folie
dempiler
cinq
cents
personnes
dans
un
appartement
où
lon
aurait
tenu
deux
cents
à
peine
alors
pourquoi
ne
pas
signer
le
contrat
sur
la
place
du
carrousel
effet
des
nouvelles
moeurs
disait
madame
chantereau
jadis
de
telles
solennités
se
passaient
en
famille
aujourdhui
il
fallait
des
cohues
la
rue
entrant
librement
un
écrasement
sans
lequel
la
soirée
semblait
froide
affichait
son
luxe
introduisait
chez
soi
lécume
de
paris
et
rien
de
plus
naturel
si
des
promiscuités
pareilles
pourrissaient
ensuite
le
foyer
ces
dames
se
plaignaient
de
ne
pas
reconnaître
plus
de
cinquante
personnes
doù
venait
tout
ça
des
jeunes
filles
décolletées
montraient
leurs
épaules
une
femme
avait
un
poignard
dor
planté
dans
son
chignon
tandis
quune
broderie
de
perles
de
jais
lhabillait
dune
cotte
de
mailles
en
suivait
une
autre
en
souriant
tellement
la
hardiesse
de
ses
jupes
collantes
semblait
singulière
tout
le
luxe
de
cette
fin
dhiver
était
là
le
monde
du
plaisir
avec
ses
tolérances
ce
quune
maîtresse
de
maison
ramasse
parmi
ses
liaisons
dun
jour
une
société
où
se
coudoyaient
de
grands
noms
et
de
grandes
hontes
dans
le
même
appétit
de
jouissances
la
chaleur
augmentait
le
quadrille
déroulait
la
symétrie
cadencée
de
ses
figures
au
milieu
des
salons
trop
pleins
très
chic
la
comtesse
reprit
la
faloise
à
la
porte
du
jardin
elle
dix
ans
de
moins
que
sa
fille
propos
foucarmont
vous
allez
nous
dire
ça
vandeuvres
pariait
quelle
navait
pas
de
cuisses
cette
pose
au
cynisme
ennuyait
ces
messieurs
foucarmont
se
contenta
de
répondre
interrogez
votre
cousin
mon
cher
justement
le
voilà
tiens
cest
une
idée
cria
la
faloise
je
parie
dix
louis
quelle
des
cuisses
fauchery
arrivait
en
effet
en
habitué
de
la
maison
il
avait
fait
le
tour
par
la
salle
à
manger
pour
éviter
lencombrement
des
portes
repris
par
rose
au
commencement
de
lhiver
il
se
partageait
entre
la
chanteuse
et
la
comtesse
très
las
ne
sachant
comment
lâcher
lune
des
deux
sabine
flattait
sa
vanité
mais
rose
lamusait
davantage
cétait
dailleurs
de
la
part
de
cette
dernière
une
passion
vraie
une
tendresse
dune
fidélité
conjugale
qui
désolait
mignon
écoute
un
renseignement
répétait
la
faloise
en
serrant
le
bras
de
son
cousin
tu
vois
cette
dame
en
soie
blanche
depuis
que
son
héritage
lui
donnait
un
aplomb
insolent
il
affectait
de
blaguer
fauchery
ayant
une
ancienne
rancune
à
satisfaire
voulant
se
venger
des
railleries
dautrefois
lorsquil
débarquait
de
sa
province
oui
cette
dame
qui
des
dentelles
le
journaliste
se
haussait
ne
comprenant
pas
encore
la
comtesse
finitil
par
dire
juste
mon
bon
jai
parié
dix
louis
atelle
des
cuisses
et
il
se
mit
à
rire
enchanté
davoir
mouché
tout
de
même
ce
gaillard
qui
lépatait
si
fort
jadis
quand
il
lui
demandait
si
la
comtesse
ne
couchait
avec
personne
mais
fauchery
sans
sétonner
le
moins
du
monde
le
regardait
fixement
idiot
va
lâchatil
enfin
en
haussant
les
épaules
puis
il
distribua
des
poignées
de
main
à
ces
messieurs
pendant
que
la
faloise
décontenancé
nétait
plus
bien
sûr
davoir
dit
quelque
chose
de
drôle
causa
depuis
les
courses
le
banquier
et
foucarmont
faisaient
partie
de
la
bande
avenue
de
villiers
nana
allait
beaucoup
mieux
le
comte
chaque
soir
venait
prendre
de
ses
nouvelles
cependant
fauchery
qui
écoutait
semblait
préoccupé
le
matin
dans
une
querelle
rose
lui
avait
carrément
avoué
lenvoi
de
la
lettre
oui
il
pouvait
se
présenter
chez
sa
dame
du
monde
il
serait
bien
reçu
après
de
longues
hésitations
il
était
venu
quand
même
par
courage
mais
limbécile
plaisanterie
de
la
faloise
le
bouleversait
sous
son
apparente
tranquillité
quavezvous
lui
demanda

vous
paraissez
souffrant
moi
pas
du
tout
jai
travaillé
cest
pourquoi
jarrive
si
tard
puis
froidement
avec
un
de
ces
héroïsmes
ignorés
qui
dénouent
les
vulgaires
tragédies
de
lexistence
je
nai
pourtant
pas
salué
les
maîtres
de
la
maison
il
faut
être
poli
même
il
osa
plaisanter
en
se
tournant
vers
la
faloise
nestce
pas
idiot
et
il
souvrit
un
passage
au
milieu
de
la
foule
la
voix
pleine
du
valet
ne
jetait
plus
des
noms
à
la
volée
pourtant
près
de
la
porte
le
comte
et
la
comtesse
causaient
encore
retenus
par
des
dames
qui
entraient
enfin
il
les
rejoignit
pendant
que
ces
messieurs
restés
sur
le
perron
du
jardin
se
haussaient
pour
voir
la
scène
nana
devait
avoir
bavardé
le
comte
ne
l
pas
aperçu
murmura
georges
attention
il
se
retourne
là
ça
est
lorchestre
venait
de
reprendre
la
valse
de
la
blonde
vénus
dabord
fauchery
avait
salué
la
comtesse
qui
souriait
toujours
dans
une
sérénité
ravie
puis
il
était
resté
un
instant
immobile
derrière
le
dos
du
comte
à
attendre
très
calme
le
comte
cette
nuitlà
gardait
sa
hautaine
gravité
le
port
de
tête
officiel
du
grand
dignitaire
lorsquil
abaissa
enfin
les
yeux
sur
le
journaliste
il
exagéra
encore
son
attitude
majestueuse
pendant
quelques
secondes
les
deux
hommes
se
regardèrent
et
ce
fut
fauchery
qui
le
premier
tendit
la
main
muffat
donna
la
sienne
leurs
mains
étaient
lune
dans
lautre
la
comtesse
sabine
souriait
devant
eux
les
cils
baissés
tandis
que
la
valse
continuellement
déroulait
son
rythme
de
polissonnerie
railleuse
mais
ça
va
tout
seul
dit
steiner
estce
que
leurs
mains
sont
collées
demanda
foucarmont
surpris
de
la
longueur
de
létreinte
un
invincible
souvenir
amenait
une
lueur
rose
aux
joues
pâles
de
fauchery
il
revoyait
le
magasin
des
accessoires
avec
son
jour
verdâtre
son
bricàbrac
couvert
de
poussière
et
muffat
trouvait
tenant
le
coquetier
abusant
de
ses
doutes
cette
heure
muffat
ne
doutait
plus
cétait
un
dernier
coin
de
dignité
qui
croulait
fauchery
soulagé
dans
sa
peur
voyant
la
gaieté
claire
de
la
comtesse
fut
pris
dune
envie
de
rire
ça
lui
semblait
comique
ah
cette
fois
cest
elle
cria
la
faloise
qui
ne
lâchait
pas
une
plaisanterie
lorsquil
la
croyait
bonne
nana
làbas
vous
la
voyez
qui
entre
taistoi
donc
idiot
murmura
philippe
quand
je
vous
dis
lui
joue
sa
valse
parbleu
elle
arrive
et
puis
elle
est
de
la
réconciliation
que
diable
comment
vous
ne
voyez
pas
elle
les
serre
sur
son
coeur
tous
les
trois
mon
cousin
cousine
et
son
époux
en
les
appelant
ses
petits
chats
moi
ça
retourne
ces
scènes
de
famille
estelle
sétait
approchée
fauchery
la
complimentait
pendant
que
raide
dans
sa
robe
rose
elle
le
regardait
de
son
air
étonné
denfant
silencieuse
en
jetant
des
coups
doeil
sur
son
père
et
sa
mère
daguenet
lui
aussi
échangeait
une
chaude
poignée
de
main
avec
le
journaliste
ils
faisaient
un
groupe
souriant
et
derrière
eux
venot
se
glissait
les
couvant
dun
oeil
béat
les
enveloppant
de
sa
douceur
dévote
heureux
de
ces
derniers
abandons
qui
préparaient
les
voies
de
la
providence
mais
la
valse
déroulait
toujours
son
balancement
de
rieuse
volupté
cétait
une
reprise
plus
haute
du
plaisir
battant
le
vieil
hôtel
comme
une
marée
montante
lorchestre
enflait
les
trilles
de
ses
petites
flûtes
les
soupirs
pâmés
de
ses
violons
sous
les
velours
de
gênes
les
ors
et
les
peintures
les
lustres
dégageaient
une
chaleur
vivante
une
poussière
de
soleil
tandis
que
la
foule
des
invités
multipliée
dans
les
glaces
semblait
sélargir
avec
le
murmure
grandi
de
ses
voix
autour
du
salon
les
couples
qui
passaient
les
mains
à
la
taille
parmi
les
sourires
des
femmes
assises
accentuaient
davantage
le
branle
des
planchers
dans
le
jardin
une
lueur
de
braise
tombée
des
lanternes
vénitiennes
éclairait
dun
lointain
reflet
dincendie
les
ombres
noires
des
promeneurs
cherchant
un
peu
dair
au
fond
des
allées
et
ce
tressaillement
des
murs
cette
nuée
rouge
étaient
comme
la
flambée
dernière
où
craquait
lantique
honneur
brûlant
aux
quatre
coins
du
logis
les
gaietés
timides
alors
à
peine
commençantes
que
fauchery
un
soir
davril
avait
entendu
sonner
avec
le
son
dun
cristal
qui
se
brise
sétaient
peu
à
peu
enhardies
affolées
jusqu
à
cet
éclat
de
fête
maintenant
la
fêlure
augmentait
elle
lézardait
la
maison
elle
annonçait
leffondrement
prochain
chez
les
ivrognes
des
faubourgs
cest
par
la
misère
noire
le
buffet
sans
pain
la
folie
de
lalcool
vidant
les
matelas
que
finissent
les
familles
gâtées
ici
sur
lécroulement
de
ces
richesses
entassées
et
allumées
dun
coup
la
valse
sonnait
le
glas
dune
vieille
race
pendant
que
nana
invisible
épandue
audessus
du
bal
avec
ses
membres
souples
décomposait
ce
monde
le
pénétrait
du
ferment
de
son
odeur
flottant
dans
lair
chaud
sur
le
rythme
canaille
de
la
musique
ce
fut
le
soir
du
mariage
à
léglise
que
le
comte
muffat
se
présenta
dans
la
chambre
de
sa
femme
où
il
nétait
pas
entré
depuis
deux
ans
la
comtesse
très
surprise
recula
dabord
mais
elle
avait
son
sourire
ce
sourire
divresse
qui
ne
la
quittait
plus
lui
très
gêné
balbutiait
alors
elle
lui
fit
un
peu
de
morale
dailleurs
ni
lun
ni
lautre
ne
risquèrent
une
explication
nette
cétait
la
religion
qui
voulait
ce
pardon
mutuel
et
il
fut
convenu
entre
eux
par
un
accord
tacite
quils
garderaient
leur
liberté
avant
de
se
mettre
au
lit
comme
la
comtesse
paraissait
hésiter
encore
ils
causèrent
affaires
le
premier
il
parla
de
vendre
les
bordes
elle
tout
de
suite
consentit
ils
avaient
de
grands
besoins
ils
partageraient
cela
acheva
la
réconciliation
muffat
en
ressentit
un
véritable
soulagement
dans
ses
remords
justement
ce
jourlà
comme
nana
sommeillait
vers
deux
heures
zoé
se
permit
de
frapper
à
la
porte
de
la
chambre
les
rideaux
étaient
tirés
un
souffle
chaud
entrait
par
une
fenêtre
dans
la
fraîcheur
silencieuse
du
demijour
dailleurs
la
jeune
femme
se
levait
maintenant
un
peu
faible
encore
elle
ouvrit
les
yeux
elle
demanda
qui
estce
zoé
allait
répondre
mais
daguenet
forçant
lentrée
sannonça
luimême
du
coup
elle
saccouda
sur
loreiller
et
renvoyant
la
femme
de
chambre
comment
cest
toi
le
jour
quon
te
marie
qu
atil
donc
lui
surpris
par
lobscurité
restait
au
milieu
de
la
pièce
cependant
il
shabituait
il
avançait
en
habit
cravaté
et
ganté
de
blanc
et
il
répétait
eh
bien
oui
cest
moi
tu
ne
te
souviens
pas
non
elle
ne
se
souvenait
de
rien
il
dut
soffrir
carrément
de
son
air
de
blague
voyons
ton
courtage
je
tapporte
létrenne
de
mon
innocence
alors
comme
il
était
au
bord
du
lit
elle
lempoigna
de
ses
bras
nus
secouée
dun
beau
rire
et
pleurant
presque
tant
elle
trouvait
ça
gentil
de
sa
part
ah
ce
mimi
estil
drôle
il
pensé
pourtant
et
moi
qui
ne
savais
plus
alors
tu
tes
échappé
tu
sors
de
léglise
cest
vrai
tu
une
odeur
dencens
mais
baisemoi
donc
oh
plus
fort
que
ça
mon
mimi
va
cest
peutêtre
la
dernière
fois
dans
la
chambre
obscure
où
traînait
encore
une
vague
odeur
déther
leur
rire
tendre
expira
la
grosse
chaleur
gonflait
les
rideaux
des
fenêtres
entendait
des
voix
denfant
sur
lavenue
puis
ils
plaisantèrent
bousculés
par
lheure
daguenet
partait
tout
de
suite
avec
sa
femme
après
le
lunch
xiii
vers
la
fin
de
septembre
le
comte
muffat
qui
devait
dîner
chez
nana
le
soir
vint
au
crépuscule
lavertir
dun
ordre
brusque
quil
avait
reçu
pour
les
tuileries
lhôtel
nétait
pas
encore
allumé
les
domestiques
riaient
très
fort
à
loffice
il
monta
doucement
lescalier
où
les
vitraux
luisaient
dans
une
ombre
chaude
en
haut
la
porte
du
salon
ne
fit
pas
de
bruit
un
jour
rose
se
mourait
au
plafond
de
la
pièce
les
tentures
rouges
les
divans
profonds
les
meubles
de
laque
ce
fouillis
détoffes
brodées
de
bronzes
et
de
faïences
dormaient
déjà
sous
une
pluie
lente
de
ténèbres
qui
noyait
les
coins
sans
un
miroitement
divoire
ni
un
reflet
dor
et
là
dans
cette
obscurité
sur
la
blancheur
seule
distincte
dun
grand
jupon
élargi
il
aperçut
nana
renversée
aux
bras
de
georges
toute
dénégation
était
impossible
il
eut
un
cri
étouffé
il
resta
béant
nana
sétait
relevée
dun
bond
et
elle
le
poussait
dans
la
chambre
pour
donner
au
petit
le
temps
de
filer
entre
murmuratelle
la
tête
perdue
je
vais
te
dire
elle
était
exaspérée
de
cette
surprise
jamais
elle
ne
cédait
ainsi
chez
elle
dans
ce
salon
les
portes
ouvertes
il
avait
fallu
toute
une
histoire
une
querelle
de
georges
enragé
de
jalousie
contre
philippe
il
sanglotait
si
fort
à
son
cou
quelle
sétait
laissé
faire
ne
sachant
comment
le
calmer
très
apitoyée
au
fond
et
pour
une
fois
quelle
commettait
la
bêtise
de
soublier
ainsi
avec
un
galopin
qui
ne
pouvait
même
plus
lui
apporter
des
bouquets
de
violettes
tant
sa
mère
le
tenait
serré
juste
le
comte
arrivait
et
tombait
droit
sur
eux
vrai
pas
de
chance
voilà
ce
quon
gagnait
à
être
bonne
fille
cependant
lobscurité
était
complète
dans
la
chambre
où
elle
avait
poussé
muffat
alors
à
tâtons
elle
sonna
furieusement
pour
demander
une
lampe
aussi
cétait
la
faute
de
julien
sil
avait
eu
une
lampe
dans
le
salon
rien
de
tout
cela
ne
serait
arrivé
cette
bête
de
nuit
qui
tombait
lui
avait
retourné
le
coeur
je
ten
prie
mon
chat
sois
raisonnable
ditelle
lorsque
zoé
eut
apporté
de
la
lumière
le
comte
assis
les
mains
sur
les
genoux
regardait
par
terre
dans
lhébétement
de
ce
quil
venait
de
voir
il
ne
trouvait
pas
un
cri
de
colère
il
tremblait
comme
pris
dune
horreur
qui
le
glaçait
cette
douleur
muette
toucha
la
jeune
femme
elle
essayait
de
le
consoler
eh
bien
oui
jai
eu
tort
cest
très
mal
ce
que
jai
fait
tu
vois
je
regrette
faute
jen
ai
beaucoup
de
chagrin
puisque
ça
te
contrarie
allons
sois
gentil
de
ton
côté
pardonnemoi
elle
sétait
accroupie
à
ses
pieds
cherchant
son
regard
dun
air
de
tendresse
soumise
pour
savoir
sil
lui
en
voulait
beaucoup
puis
comme
il
se
remettait
en
soupirant
longuement
elle
se
fit
plus
câline
elle
donna
une
dernière
raison
avec
une
bonté
grave
voistu
chéri
il
faut
comprendre
je
ne
puis
refuser
ça
à
mes
amis
pauvres
le
comte
se
laissa
fléchir
il
exigea
seulement
le
renvoi
de
georges
mais
toute
illusion
était
morte
il
ne
croyait
plus
à
la
fidélité
jurée
le
lendemain
nana
le
tromperait
de
nouveau
et
il
ne
restait
dans
le
tourment
de
sa
possession
que
par
un
besoin
lâche
par
une
épouvante
de
la
vie
à
lidée
de
vivre
sans
elle
ce
fut
lépoque
de
son
existence
où
nana
éclaira
paris
dun
redoublement
de
splendeur
elle
grandit
encore
à
lhorizon
du
vice
elle
domina
la
ville
de
linsolence
affichée
de
son
luxe
de
son
mépris
de
largent
qui
lui
faisait
fondre
publiquement
les
fortunes
dans
son
hôtel
il
avait
comme
un
éclat
de
forge
ses
continuels
désirs
flambaient
un
petit
souffle
de
ses
lèvres
changeait
lor
en
une
cendre
fine
que
le
vent
balayait
à
chaque
heure
jamais
navait
vu
une
pareille
rage
de
dépense
lhôtel
semblait
bâti
sur
un
gouffre
les
hommes
avec
leurs
biens
leurs
corps
jusqu
à
leurs
noms
engloutissaient
sans
laisser
la
trace
dun
peu
de
poussière
cette
fille
aux
goûts
de
perruche
croquant
des
radis
et
des
pralines
chipotant
la
viande
avait
chaque
mois
pour
sa
table
des
comptes
de
cinq
mille
francs
cétait
à
loffice
un
gaspillage
effréné
un
coulage
féroce
qui
éventrait
les
barriques
de
vin
qui
roulait
des
notes
enflées
par
trois
ou
quatre
mains
successives
victorine
et
françois
régnaient
en
maîtres
dans
la
cuisine
où
ils
invitaient
du
monde
en
dehors
dun
petit
peuple
de
cousins
nourris
à
domicile
de
viandes
froides
et
de
bouillon
gras
julien
exigeait
des
remises
chez
les
fournisseurs
les
vitriers
ne
remettaient
pas
un
carreau
de
trente
sous
sans
quil
en
fît
ajouter
vingt
pour
lui
charles
mangeait
lavoine
des
chevaux
doublant
les
fournitures
revendant
par
une
porte
de
derrière
ce
qui
entrait
par
la
grande
porte
tandis
que
au
milieu
de
ce
pillage
général
de
ce
sac
de
ville
emportée
dassaut
zoé
à
force
dart
parvenait
à
sauver
les
apparences
couvrait
les
vols
de
tous
pour
mieux
confondre
et
sauver
les
siens
mais
ce
quon
perdait
était
pis
encore
la
nourriture
de
la
veille
jetée
à
la
borne
un
encombrement
de
provisions
dont
les
domestiques
se
dégoûtaient
le
sucre
empoissant
les
verres
le
gaz
brûlant
à
pleins
becs
jusqu
à
faire
sauter
les
murs
et
des
négligences
et
des
méchancetés
et
des
accidents
tout
ce
qui
peut
hâter
la
ruine
dans
une
maison
dévorée
par
tant
de
bouches
puis
en
haut
chez
madame
la
débâcle
soufflait
plus
fort
des
robes
de
dix
mille
francs
mises
deux
fois
vendues
par
zoé
des
bijoux
qui
disparaissaient
comme
émiettés
au
fond
des
tiroirs
des
achats
bêtes
les
nouveautés
du
jour
oubliées
le
lendemain
dans
les
coins
balayées
à
la
rue
elle
ne
pouvait
voir
quelque
chose
de
très
cher
sans
en
avoir
envie
elle
faisait
ainsi
autour
delle
un
continuel
désastre
de
fleurs
de
bibelots
précieux
dautant
plus
heureuse
que
son
caprice
dune
heure
coûtait
davantage
rien
ne
lui
restait
aux
mains
elle
cassait
tout
ça
se
fanait
ça
se
salissait
entre
ses
petits
doigts
blancs
une
jonchée
de
débris
sans
nom
de
lambeaux
tordus
de
loques
boueuses
la
suivait
et
marquait
son
passage
ensuite
éclataient
les
gros
règlements
au
milieu
de
ce
gâchis
de
largent
de
poche
vingt
mille
francs
chez
la
modiste
trente
mille
chez
la
lingère
douze
mille
chez
le
bottier
son
écurie
lui
en
mangeait
cinquante
mille
en
six
mois
elle
eut
chez
son
couturier
une
note
de
cent
vingt
mille
francs
sans
quelle
eût
augmenté
son
train
estimé
par
labordette
à
quatre
cent
mille
francs
en
moyenne
elle
atteignit
cette
annéelà
le
million
stupéfaite
ellemême
de
ce
chiffre
incapable
de
dire
où
avait
pu
passer
une
pareille
somme
les
hommes
entassés
les
uns
pardessus
les
autres
lor
vidé
à
pleine
brouette
ne
parvenaient
pas
à
combler
le
trou
qui
toujours
se
creusait
sous
le
pavé
de
son
hôtel
dans
les
craquements
de
son
luxe
cependant
nana
nourrissait
un
dernier
caprice
travaillée
une
fois
encore
par
lidée
de
refaire
sa
chambre
elle
croyait
avoir
trouvé
une
chambre
de
velours
rose
thé
à
petits
capitons
dargent
tendue
jusquau
plafond
en
forme
de
tente
garnie
de
cordelières
et
dune
dentelle
dor
cela
lui
semblait
devoir
être
riche
et
tendre
un
fond
superbe
à
sa
peau
vermeille
de
rousse
mais
la
chambre
dailleurs
était
simplement
faite
pour
servir
de
cadre
au
lit
un
prodige
un
éblouissement
nana
rêvait
un
lit
comme
il
nen
existait
pas
un
trône
un
autel
où
paris
viendrait
adorer
sa
nudité
souveraine
il
serait
tout
en
et
en
argent
repoussés
pareil
à
un
grand
bijou
des
roses
dor
jetées
sur
un
treillis
dargent
au
chevet
une
bande
damours
parmi
les
fleurs
se
pencheraient
avec
des
rires
guettant
les
voluptés
dans
lombre
des
rideaux
elle
sétait
adressée
à
labordette
qui
lui
avait
amené
deux
orfèvres
soccupait
déjà
des
dessins
le
lit
coûterait
cinquante
mille
francs
et
muffat
devait
le
lui
donner
pour
ses
étrennes
ce
qui
étonnait
la
jeune
femme
cétait
dans
ce
fleuve
dor
dont
le
flot
lui
coulait
entre
les
membres
dêtre
sans
cesse
à
court
dargent
certains
jours
elle
se
trouvait
aux
abois
pour
des
sommes
ridicules
de
quelques
louis
il
lui
fallait
emprunter
à
zoé
ou
bien
elle
battait
monnaie
ellemême
comme
elle
pouvait
mais
avant
de
se
résigner
aux
moyens
extrêmes
elle
tâtait
ses
amis
tirant
des
hommes
ce
quils
avaient
sur
eux
jusqu
à
des
sous
dun
air
de
plaisanterie
depuis
trois
mois
elle
vidait
surtout
ainsi
les
poches
de
philippe
il
ne
venait
plus
dans
les
moments
de
crise
sans
laisser
son
portemonnaie
bientôt
enhardie
elle
lui
avait
demandé
des
emprunts
deux
cents
francs
trois
cents
francs
jamais
davantage
pour
des
billets
des
dettes
criardes
et
philippe
nommé
en
juillet
capitaine
trésorier
apportait
largent
le
lendemain
en
sexcusant
de
nêtre
pas
riche
car
la
bonne
maman
hugon
traitait
maintenant
ses
fils
avec
une
sévérité
singulière
au
bout
de
trois
mois
ces
petits
prêts
souvent
renouvelés
montaient
à
une
dizaine
de
mille
francs
le
capitaine
avait
toujours
son
beau
rire
sonore
pourtant
il
maigrissait
distrait
parfois
une
ombre
de
souffrance
sur
la
face
mais
un
regard
de
nana
le
transfigurait
dans
une
sorte
dextase
sensuelle
elle
était
très
chatte
avec
lui
le
grisait
de
baisers
derrière
les
portes
le
possédait
par
des
abandons
brusques
qui
le
clouaient
derrière
ses
jupes
dès
quil
pouvait
séchapper
de
son
service
un
soir
nana
ayant
dit
quelle
sappelait
aussi
thérèse
et
que
sa
fête
tombait
le
octobre
ces
messieurs
lui
envoyèrent
tous
des
cadeaux
le
capitaine
philippe
apporta
le
sien
un
ancien
drageoir
en
porcelaine
de
saxe
monté
sur
il
la
trouva
seule
dans
son
cabinet
de
toilette
au
sortir
du
bain
vêtue
seulement
dun
grand
peignoir
de
flanelle
blanche
et
rouge
et
très
occupée
à
examiner
les
cadeaux
étalés
sur
une
table
elle
avait
déjà
cassé
un
flacon
de
cristal
de
roche
en
voulant
le
déboucher
oh
tu
es
trop
gentil
ditelle
questce
que
cest
montre
un
peu
estu
enfant
de
mettre
tes
sous
à
des
petites
machines
comme
ça
elle
le
grondait
puisquil
nétait
pas
riche
très
contente
au
fond
de
le
voir
dépenser
tout
pour
elle
la
seule
preuve
damour
qui
la
touchât
cependant
elle
travaillait
le
drageoir
elle
voulait
voir
comment
cétait
fait
louvrant
le
refermant
prends
garde
murmuratil
cest
fragile
mais
elle
haussa
les
épaules
il
lui
croyait
donc
des
mains
de
portefaix
et
tout
à
coup
la
charnière
lui
resta
aux
doigts
le
couvercle
tomba
et
se
brisa
elle
demeurait
stupéfaite
les
yeux
sur
les
morceaux
disant
oh
il
est
cassé
puis
elle
se
mit
à
rire
les
morceaux
par
terre
lui
semblaient
drôles
cétait
une
gaieté
nerveuse
elle
avait
le
rire
bête
et
méchant
dun
enfant
que
la
destruction
amuse
philippe
fut
pris
dune
courte
révolte
la
malheureuse
ignorait
quelles
angoisses
lui
coûtait
ce
bibelot
quand
elle
le
vit
bouleversé
elle
tâcha
de
se
retenir
par
exemple
ce
nest
pas
faute
il
était
fêlé
ça
ne
tient
plus
ces
vieilleries
aussi
cest
ce
couvercle
astu
vu
la
cabriole
et
elle
repartit
dun
fou
rire
mais
comme
les
yeux
du
jeune
homme
se
mouillaient
malgré
son
effort
elle
se
jeta
tendrement
à
son
cou
estu
bête
je
taime
tout
de
même
si
lon
ne
cassait
rien
les
marchands
ne
vendraient
plus
tout
ça
est
fait
pour
être
cassé
tiens
cet
éventail
estce
que
cest
collé
seulement
elle
avait
saisi
un
éventail
tirant
sur
les
branches
et
la
soie
se
déchira
en
deux
cela
parut
lexciter
pour
faire
voir
quelle
se
moquait
des
autres
cadeaux
du
moment
où
elle
venait
dabîmer
le
sien
elle
se
donna
le
régal
dun
massacre
tapant
les
objets
prouvant
quil
n
en
avait
pas
un
de
solide
en
les
détruisant
tous
une
lueur
sallumait
dans
ses
yeux
vides
un
petit
retroussement
des
lèvres
montrait
ses
dents
blanches
puis
lorsque
tous
furent
en
morceaux
très
rouge
reprise
de
son
rire
elle
frappa
la
table
de
ses
mains
élargies
elle
zézaya
dune
voix
de
gamine
fini
n
plus
n
plus
alors
philippe
gagné
par
cette
ivresse
ségaya
et
lui
baisa
la
gorge
en
la
renversant
en
arrière
elle
sabandonnait
elle
se
pendait
à
ses
épaules
si
heureuse
quelle
ne
se
rappelait
pas
sêtre
tant
amusée
depuis
longtemps
et
sans
le
lâcher
dun
ton
de
caresse
dis
donc
chéri
tu
devrais
bien
mapporter
dix
louis
demain
un
embêtement
une
note
de
mon
boulanger
qui
tourmente
il
était
devenu
pâle
puis
en
lui
mettant
un
dernier
baiser
sur
le
front
il
dit
simplement
je
tâcherai
un
silence
régna
elle
shabillait
lui
appuyait
le
front
à
une
vitre
au
bout
dune
minute
il
revint
il
reprit
avec
lenteur
nana
tu
devrais
mépouser
du
coup
cette
idée
égaya
tellement
la
jeune
femme
quelle
ne
pouvait
achever
de
nouer
ses
jupons
mais
mon
pauvre
chien
tu
es
malade
estce
parce
que
je
te
demande
dix
louis
que
tu
moffres
ta
main
jamais
je
taime
trop
en
voilà
une
bêtise
par
exemple
et
comme
zoé
entrait
pour
la
chausser
ils
ne
parlèrent
plus
de
ça
la
femme
de
chambre
avait
tout
de
suite
guigné
les
cadeaux
en
miettes
sur
la
table
elle
demanda
sil
fallait
serrer
ces
choses
et
madame
ayant
dit
de
les
jeter
elle
emporta
tout
dans
un
coin
de
sa
jupe
la
cuisine
chiffonnait
se
partageait
les
débris
de
madame
ce
jourlà
georges
malgré
la
défense
de
nana
sétait
introduit
dans
lhôtel
françois
lavait
bien
vu
passer
mais
les
domestiques
en
arrivaient
à
rire
entre
eux
des
embarras
de
la
bourgeoise
il
venait
de
se
glisser
jusquau
petit
salon
lorsque
la
voix
de
son
frère
larrêta
et
cloué
derrière
la
porte
il
entendit
toute
la
scène
les
baisers
loffre
de
mariage
une
horreur
le
glaçait
il
sen
alla
imbécile
avec
la
sensation
dun
grand
vide
sous
le
crâne
ce
fut
seulement
rue
richelieu
dans
sa
chambre
audessus
de
lappartement
de
sa
mère
que
son
coeur
creva
en
furieux
sanglots
cette
fois
il
ne
pouvait
douter
une
image
abominable
toujours
se
levait
devant
ses
yeux
nana
aux
bras
de
philippe
et
cela
lui
semblait
un
inceste
quand
il
se
croyait
calmé
le
souvenir
revenait
une
nouvelle
crise
de
rage
jalouse
le
jetait
sur
son
lit
mordant
les
draps
criant
des
mots
infâmes
qui
laffolaient
davantage
la
journée
se
passa
de
la
sorte
il
parla
dune
migraine
pour
rester
enfermé
mais
la
nuit
fut
plus
terrible
encore
une
fièvre
de
meurtre
le
secouait
dans
de
continuels
cauchemars
si
son
frère
avait
habité
la
maison
il
serait
allé
le
tuer
dun
coup
de
couteau
au
jour
il
voulut
raisonner
cétait
lui
qui
devait
mourir
il
se
jetterait
par
la
fenêtre
quand
un
omnibus
passerait
pourtant
il
sortit
vers
dix
heures
il
courut
paris
rôda
sur
les
ponts
éprouva
au
dernier
moment
linvincible
besoin
de
revoir
nana
peutêtre
dun
mot
le
sauveraitelle
et
trois
heures
sonnaient
comme
il
entrait
dans
lhôtel
de
lavenue
de
villiers
vers
midi
une
nouvelle
affreuse
avait
écrasé
madame
hugon
philippe
était
en
prison
de
la
veille
au
soir
laccusait
davoir
volé
douze
mille
francs
à
la
caisse
de
son
régiment
depuis
trois
mois
il
détournait
de
petites
sommes
espérant
les
remettre
dissimulant
le
déficit
par
de
fausses
pièces
et
cette
fraude
réussissait
toujours
grâce
aux
négligences
du
conseil
dadministration
la
vieille
dame
atterrée
devant
le
crime
de
son
enfant
eut
un
premier
cri
de
colère
contre
nana
elle
savait
la
liaison
de
philippe
ses
tristesses
venaient
de
ce
malheur
qui
la
retenait
à
paris
dans
la
crainte
dune
catastrophe
mais
jamais
elle
navait
redouté
tant
de
honte
et
maintenant
elle
se
reprochait
ses
refus
dargent
comme
une
complicité
tombée
sur
un
fauteuil
les
jambes
prises
par
la
paralysie
elle
se
sentait
inutile
incapable
dune
démarche
clouée
là
pour
mourir
pourtant
la
pensée
brusque
de
georges
la
consola
georges
lui
restait
il
pourrait
agir
les
sauver
peutêtre
alors
sans
demander
le
secours
de
personne
désirant
ensevelir
ces
choses
entre
eux
elle
se
traîna
et
monta
létage
rattachée
à
cette
idée
quelle
avait
encore
une
tendresse
auprès
delle
mais
en
haut
elle
trouva
la
chambre
vide
le
concierge
lui
dit
que
monsieur
georges
était
sorti
de
bonne
heure
un
second
malheur
soufflait
dans
cette
chambre
le
lit
avec
ses
draps
mordus
contait
toute
une
angoisse
une
chaise
jetée
à
terre
parmi
des
vêtements
semblait
morte
georges
devait
être
chez
cette
femme
et
madame
hugon
les
yeux
secs
les
jambes
fortes
descendit
elle
voulait
ses
fils
elle
partait
les
réclamer
depuis
le
matin
nana
avait
des
embêtements
dabord
cétait
ce
boulanger
qui
dès
neuf
heures
avait
paru
avec
sa
note
une
misère
cent
trentetrois
francs
de
pain
quelle
ne
parvenait
pas
à
solder
au
milieu
du
train
royal
de
lhôtel
il
sétait
présenté
vingt
fois
irrité
davoir
été
changé
du
jour
où
il
avait
coupé
le
crédit
et
les
domestiques
épousaient
sa
cause
françois
disait
que
madame
ne
le
paierait
jamais
sil
ne
faisait
pas
une
bonne
scène
charles
parlait
de
monter
aussi
pour
régler
un
vieux
compte
de
paille
resté
en
arrière
pendant
que
victorine
conseillait
dattendre
la
présence
dun
monsieur
et
de
tirer
largent
en
tombant
en
plein
dans
la
conversation
la
cuisine
se
passionnait
tous
les
fournisseurs
étaient
mis
au
courant
cétaient
des
commérages
de
trois
et
quatre
heures
madame
déshabillée
épluchée
racontée
avec
lacharnement
dune
domesticité
oisive
qui
crevait
de
bienêtre
seul
julien
le
maître
dhôtel
affectait
de
défendre
madame
tout
de
même
elle
était
chic
et
quand
les
autres
laccusaient
de
coucher
avec
il
riait
dun
air
fat
ce
qui
mettait
la
cuisinière
hors
delle
car
elle
aurait
voulu
être
un
homme
pour
cracher
sur
le
derrière
de
ces
femmes
tant
ça
laurait
dégoûtée
méchamment
françois
avait
posté
le
boulanger
dans
le
vestibule
sans
avertir
madame
comme
elle
descendait
madame
le
trouva
devant
elle
à
lheure
du
déjeuner
elle
prit
la
note
elle
lui
dit
de
revenir
vers
trois
heures
alors
avec
de
sales
mots
il
partit
en
jurant
dêtre
exact
et
de
se
payer
luimême
nimporte
comment
nana
déjeuna
fort
mal
vexée
de
cette
scène
cette
fois
il
fallait
se
débarrasser
de
cet
homme
dix
reprises
elle
avait
mis
de
côté
son
argent
mais
largent
sétait
toujours
fondu
un
jour
pour
des
fleurs
un
autre
jour
pour
une
souscription
faite
en
faveur
dun
vieux
gendarme
dailleurs
elle
comptait
sur
philippe
elle
sétonnait
même
de
ne
pas
le
voir
avec
ses
deux
cents
francs
cétait
un
vrai
guignon
lavantveille
elle
avait
encore
nippé
satin
tout
un
trousseau
près
de
douze
cents
francs
de
robes
et
de
linge
et
il
ne
lui
restait
pas
un
louis
chez
elle
vers
deux
heures
comme
nana
commençait
à
être
inquiète
labordette
se
présenta
il
apportait
les
dessins
du
lit
ce
fut
une
diversion
un
coup
de
joie
qui
fit
tout
oublier
à
la
jeune
femme
elle
tapait
des
mains
elle
dansait
puis
gonflée
de
curiosité
penchée
audessus
dune
table
du
salon
elle
examina
les
dessins
que
labordette
lui
expliquait
tu
vois
ceci
est
le
bateau
au
milieu
une
touffe
de
roses
épanouies
puis
une
guirlande
de
fleurs
et
de
boutons
les
feuillages
seront
en
vert
et
les
roses
en
rouge
et
voici
la
grande
pièce
du
chevet
une
ronde
damours
sur
un
treillis
dargent
mais
nana
linterrompit
emportée
par
le
ravissement
oh
quil
est
drôle
le
petit
celui
du
coin
qui
le
derrière
en
lair
hein
et
ce
rire
malin
ils
ont
tous
des
yeux
dun
cochon
tu
sais
mon
cher
jamais
je
noserai
faire
des
bêtises
devant
eux
elle
était
dans
une
satisfaction
dorgueil
extraordinaire
les
orfèvres
avaient
dit
que
pas
une
reine
ne
couchait
dans
un
lit
pareil
seulement
il
se
présentait
une
complication
labordette
lui
montra
deux
dessins
pour
la
pièce
des
pieds
lun
qui
reproduisait
le
motif
des
bateaux
lautre
qui
était
tout
un
sujet
la
nuit
enveloppée
dans
ses
voiles
et
dont
un
faune
découvrait
léclatante
nudité
il
ajouta
que
si
elle
choisissait
le
sujet
les
orfèvres
avaient
lintention
de
donner
à
la
nuit
sa
ressemblance
cette
idée
dun
goût
risqué
la
fit
pâlir
de
plaisir
elle
se
voyait
en
statuette
dargent
dans
le
symbole
des
tièdes
voluptés
de
lombre
bien
entendu
tu
ne
poserais
que
pour
la
tête
et
les
épaules
dit
labordette
elle
le
regarda
tranquillement
pourquoi
du
moment
où
il
sagit
dune
oeuvre
dart
je
fiche
pas
mal
du
sculpteur
qui
prendra
chose
entendue
elle
choisissait
le
sujet
mais
il
larrêta
attends
cest
six
mille
francs
de
plus
par
exemple
cest
ça
qui
mest
égal
criatelle
en
éclatant
de
rire
estce
que
mon
petit
mufe
n
pas
le
sac
maintenant
avec
ses
intimes
elle
appelait
ainsi
le
comte
muffat
et
ces
messieurs
ne
la
questionnaient
plus
sur
lui
autrement
tu
vu
ton
petit
mufe
hier
soir
tiens
je
croyais
trouver
ici
le
petit
mufe
une
simple
familiarité
que
pourtant
elle
ne
se
permettait
pas
encore
en
sa
présence
labordette
roulait
les
dessins
en
donnant
des
dernières
explications
les
orfèvres
sengageaient
à
livrer
le
lit
dans
deux
mois
vers
le
décembre
dès
la
semaine
suivante
un
sculpteur
viendrait
pour
la
maquette
de
la
nuit
comme
elle
le
reconduisait
nana
se
rappela
le
boulanger
et
brusquement
propos
tu
naurais
pas
dix
louis
sur
toi
un
principe
de
labordette
dont
il
se
trouvait
bien
était
de
ne
jamais
prêter
dargent
aux
femmes
il
faisait
toujours
la
même
réponse
non
fille
je
suis
à
sec
mais
veuxtu
que
jaille
chez
ton
petit
mufe
elle
refusa
cétait
inutile
deux
jours
auparavant
elle
avait
tiré
cinq
mille
francs
du
comte
cependant
elle
regretta
sa
discrétion
derrière
labordette
bien
quil
fût
à
peine
deux
heures
et
demie
le
boulanger
reparut
et
il
sinstalla
sur
une
banquette
du
vestibule
brutalement
en
jurant
très
haut
la
jeune
femme
lécoutait
du
premier
étage
elle
pâlissait
elle
souffrait
surtout
dentendre
grandir
jusqu
à
elle
la
joie
sourde
des
domestiques
crevait
de
rire
dans
la
cuisine
le
cocher
regardait
du
fond
de
la
cour
françois
traversait
sans
raison
le
vestibule
puis
se
hâtait
daller
donner
des
nouvelles
après
avoir
jeté
au
boulanger
un
ricanement
dintelligence
se
fichait
de
madame
les
murs
éclataient
elle
se
sentait
toute
seule
dans
le
mépris
de
loffice
qui
la
guettait
et
léclaboussait
dune
blague
ordurière
alors
comme
elle
avait
eu
lidée
demprunter
les
cent
trentetrois
francs
à
zoé
elle
labandonna
elle
lui
devait
déjà
de
largent
elle
était
trop
fière
pour
risquer
un
refus
une
telle
émotion
la
soulevait
quelle
rentra
dans
sa
chambre
en
parlant
tout
haut
va
va
fille
ne
compte
que
sur
toi
ton
corps
tappartient
et
il
vaut
mieux
ten
servir
que
de
subir
un
affront
et
sans
même
appeler
zoé
elle
shabillait
fiévreusement
pour
courir
chez
la
tricon
cétait
sa
suprême
ressource
aux
heures
de
gros
embarras
très
demandée
toujours
sollicitée
par
la
vieille
dame
elle
refusait
ou
se
résignait
selon
ses
besoins
et
les
jours
de
plus
en
plus
fréquents
où
des
trous
se
faisaient
dans

sans

frappait
au
coeur
dun
grand
coup
dont
il
se
sentait

elle
ne

heureuse
de

toujours
trop
long
quand

puis
le
prenant
le
baisant
au
front
adieu
bébé
cest
fini
bien
fini
entendstu
je
sauve
et
elle
le
quitta
il
était
debout
au
milieu
du
salon
les
derniers
mots
sonnaient
comme
un
tocsin
à
ses
oreilles
cest
fini
bien
fini
et
il
croyait
que
la
terre
souvrait
sous
ses
pieds
dans
le
vide
de
son
cerveau
lhomme
qui
attendait
nana
avait
disparu
seul
philippe
demeurait
aux
bras
nus
de
la
jeune
femme
continuellement
elle
ne
niait
pas
elle
laimait
puisquelle
voulait
lui
éviter
le
chagrin
dune
infidélité
cétait
fini
bien
fini
il
respira
fortement
il
regarda
autour
de
la
pièce
étouffé
par
un
poids
qui
lécrasait
des
souvenirs
lui
revenaient
un
à
un
les
nuits
rieuses
de
la
mignotte
des
heures
de
caresse
où
il
se
croyait
son
enfant
puis
des
voluptés
volées
dans
cette
pièce
même
et
jamais
jamais
plus
il
était
trop
petit
il
navait
pas
grandi
assez
vite
philippe
le
remplaçait
parce
quil
avait
de
la
barbe
alors
cétait
la
fin
il
ne
pouvait
plus
vivre
son
vice
sétait
trempé
dune
tendresse
infinie
dune
adoration
sensuelle
où
tout
son
être
se
donnait
puis
comment
oublier
lorsque
son
frère
resterait
là
son
frère
un
peu
de
son
sang
un
autre
moi
dont
le
plaisir
lenrageait
de
jalousie
cétait
la
fin
il
voulait
mourir
toutes
les
portes
demeuraient
ouvertes
dans
la
débandade
bruyante
des
domestiques
qui
avaient
vu
madame
sortir
à
pied
en
bas
sur
la
banquette
du
vestibule
le
boulanger
riait
avec
charles
et
françois
comme
zoé
traversait
le
salon
en
courant
elle
parut
surprise
de
voir
georges
et
lui
demanda
sil
attendait
madame
oui
il
lattendait
il
avait
oublié
de
lui
rendre
une
réponse
et
quand
il
fut
seul
il
se
mit
à
chercher
ne
trouvant
rien
autre
il
prit
dans
le
cabinet
de
toilette
une
paire
de
ciseaux
très
pointus
dont
nana
avait
la
continuelle
manie
de
se
servir
pour
éplucher
sa
personne
se
rognant
des
peaux
se
coupant
des
poils
alors
pendant
une
heure
il
patienta
les
doigts
collés
nerveusement
aux
ciseaux
la
main
dans
la
poche
voilà
madame
dit
en
revenant
zoé
qui
avait
dû
la
guetter
par
la
fenêtre
de
la
chambre

eut
des
courses

il
la
suivait
pendant
quelle
se
dirigeait
vers
la
chambre
nana
veuxtu
mépouser
mais
elle
haussa
les
épaules
cétait
trop
bête
elle
ne

son
idée
était
de
lui

la
porte
sur
la
figure
nana

elle
lança
la
porte
dune
main
il
la
rouvrit
tandis
quil
sortait

main
de
la
poche
avec
les
ciseaux
et
simplement
dun
grand
coup
il
se
les
enfonça
dans
la
poitrine
cependant
nana
avait
eu
conscience
dun
malheur
elle
sétait
tournée
quand
elle
le
vit
se
frapper
elle
fut
prise
dune
indignation
mais

de
se
porter
un
second
coup
qui
lavait
jeté
tout
de
son
long
sur
le
tapis
il
barrait
le
seuil
de
la
chambre
alors
elle
perdit
complètement
la
tête
criant
de
toutes
ses
forces
nosant
enjamber
ce
corps
qui
lenfermait
et
lempêchait
de
courir
chercher

peur
il
était
tout
blanc
les
yeux
fermés
ça
ne
saignait
presque
pas
à
peine
un
peu
de
sang
dont
la
tache
mince
se
perdait
sous
le
gilet
elle
se
décidait
à
passer
sur
le
corps
lorsquune
apparition
la
fit
reculer
en
face
delle
par
la
porte
du
salon
restée
grande
ouverte
une
vieille
dame
savançait
et
elle
reconnaissait
madame
hugon
terrifiée
ne
sexpliquant
pas
cette
présence
elle
reculait
toujours
elle
avait
encore
ses
gants
et
son
chapeau
sa
terreur
devint
telle
quelle
se
défendit
la
voix
bégayante
madame
ce
nest
pas

je
vous
jure
il
voulait
mépouser
jai
dit
non
et
il
sest
tué
lentement
madame
hugon
sapprochait
vêtue
de
noir
la
figure
pâle
avec
ses
cheveux
blancs
dans
la
voiture
lidée
de
georges
sen
était
allée
la
faute
de
philippe
lavait
reprise
tout
entière
peutêtre
cette
femme
pourraitelle
donner
aux
juges
des
explications
qui
les
toucheraient
et
le
projet
lui
venait
de
la
supplier
pour
quelle
déposât
en
faveur
de
son
fils
en
bas
les
portes
de
lhôtel
étaient
ouvertes
elle
hésitait
dans
lescalier
avec
ses
mauvaises
jambes
lorsque
tout
dun
coup
des
appels
dépouvante
lavaient
dirigée
puis
en
haut
un
homme
se
trouvait
par
terre
la
chemise
tachée
de
rouge
cétait
georges
cétait
son
autre
enfant
nana
répétait
dun
ton
imbécile
il
voulait
mépouser

il
sest
tué
sans
un
cri
madame
hugon
se
baissa
oui
cétait
lautre
cétait
georges
lun
déshonoré
lautre
assassiné
cela
ne
la
surprenait
pas
dans
lécroulement
de
toute
sa
vie
agenouillée
sur
le
tapis
ignorante
du
lieu
où
elle
était
napercevant
personne
elle
regardait
fixement
le
visage
de
georges
elle
écoutait
une
main
sur
son
coeur
puis
elle
poussa
un
faible
soupir
elle
avait
senti
le
coeur
battre
alors
elle
leva
la
tête
examina
cette
chambre
et
cette
femme
parut
se
rappeler
une
flamme
sallumait
dans
ses
yeux
vides
elle
était
si
grande
et
si
terrible
de
silence
que
nana
tremblait
en
continuant
de
se
défendre
pardessus
ce
corps
qui
les
séparait
je
vous
jure
madame
si
son
frère
était
là
il
pourrait
vous
expliquer
son
frère
volé
il
est
en
prison
dit
la
mère
durement
nana
resta
étranglée
mais
pourquoi
tout
ça
lautre
avait
volé
à
présent
ils
étaient
donc
fous
dans
cette
famille
elle
ne
se
débattait
plus
nayant
pas
lair
chez
elle
laissant
madame
hugon
donner
des
ordres
des
domestiques
avaient
fini
par
accourir
la
vieille
dame
voulut
absolument
quils
descendissent
georges
évanoui
dans
sa
voiture
elle
aimait
mieux
le
tuer
et
lemporter
de
cette
maison
nana
de
ses
regards
stupéfaits
suivit
les
domestiques
qui
tenaient
ce
pauvre
zizi
par
les
épaules
et
par
les
jambes
la
mère
marchait
derrière
épuisée
maintenant
sappuyant
aux
meubles
comme
jetée
au
néant
de
tout
ce
quelle
aimait
sur
le
palier
elle
eut
un
sanglot
elle
se
retourna
et
dit
à
deux
reprises
ah
vous
nous
avez
fait
bien
du
mal
vous
nous
avez
fait
bien
du
mal
ce
fut
tout
nana
sétait
assise
dans
sa
stupeur
encore
gantée
et
son
chapeau
sur
la
tête
lhôtel
retombait
à
un
silence
lourd
la
voiture
venait
de
partir
et
elle
demeurait
immobile
nayant
pas
une
idée
la
tête
bourdonnante
de
cette
histoire
un
quart
dheure
plus
tard
le
comte
muffat
la
trouva
à
la
même
place
mais
alors
elle
se
soulagea
par
un
flux
débordant
de
paroles
lui
contant
le
malheur
revenant
vingt
fois
sur
les
mêmes
détails
ramassant
les
ciseaux
tachés
de
sang
pour
refaire
le
geste
de
zizi
quand
il
sétait
frappé
et
elle
avait
surtout
à
coeur
de
prouver
son
innocence
voyons
chéri
estce
faute
si
tu
étais
la
justice
estce
que
tu
condamnerais
je
nai
pas

à
philippe

grenouille

petit
malheureux

se
massacrer
dans
tout
ça
je
suis
la
plus
malheureuse
vient
faire
ses
bêtises
chez
moi
cause
de
la
peine
traite
comme
une
coquine
et
elle
se
mit
à
pleurer
une
détente
nerveuse
la
rendait
molle
et
dolente
très
attendrie
avec
un
immense
chagrin
toi
aussi
tu
lair
de
nêtre
pas
content
demande
un
peu
à
zoé
si
j
suis
pour
quelque
chose
zoé
parlez
donc
expliquez
à
monsieur
depuis
un
instant
la
femme
de
chambre
qui
avait
pris
dans
le
cabinet
une
serviette
et
une
cuvette
deau
frottait
le
tapis
pour
enlever
une
tache
de
sang
pendant
que
cétait
frais
oh
monsieur
déclaratelle
madame
est
assez
désolée
muffat
restait
saisi
glacé
par
ce
drame
la
pensée
pleine
de
cette
mère
pleurant
ses
fils
il
connaissait
son
grand
coeur
il
la
voyait
dans
ses
habits
de
veuve
séteignant
seule
aux
fondettes
mais
nana
se
désespérait
plus
fort
maintenant
limage
de
zizi
tombé
par
terre
avec
un
trou
rouge
sur
sa
chemise
la
jetait
hors
delle
il
était
si
mignon
si
doux
si
caressant
ah
tu
sais
mon
chat
tant
pis
si
ça
te
vexe
je
laimais
ce
bébé
je
ne
peux
pas
retenir
cest
plus
fort
que
moi
et
puis
ça
ne
doit
rien
te
faire
à
présent
il
nest
plus
là
tu
ce
que
tu
voulais
tu
es
bien
sûr
de
ne
plus
nous
surprendre
et
cette
dernière
idée
létrangla
dun
tel
regret
quil
finit
par
la
consoler
allons
elle
devait
se
montrer
forte
elle
avait
raison
ce
nétait
pas
sa
faute
mais
elle
sarrêta
dellemême
pour
dire
écoute
tu
vas
courir
chercher
de
ses
nouvelles
tout
de
suite
je
veux
il
prit
son
chapeau
et
alla
chercher
des
nouvelles
de
georges
au
bout
de
trois
quarts
dheure
quand
il
revint
il
aperçut
nana
penchée
anxieusement
à
une
fenêtre
et
il
lui
cria
du
trottoir
que
le
petit
nétait
pas
mort
et
quon
espérait
même
le
sauver
alors
elle
sauta
tout
de
suite
à
une
grande
joie
elle
chantait
dansait
trouvait
lexistence
belle
zoé
cependant
nétait
pas
contente
de
son
lavage
elle
regardait
toujours
la
tache
elle
répétait
chaque
fois
en
passant
vous
savez
madame
que
ce
nest
pas
parti
en
effet
la
tache
reparaissait
dun
rouge
pâle
sur
une
rosace
blanche
du
tapis
cétait
au
seuil
même
de
la
chambre
comme
un
trait
de
sang
qui
barrait
la
porte
bah
dit
nana
heureuse
ça
sen
ira
sous
les
pieds
dès
le
lendemain
le
comte
muffat
avait
lui
aussi
oublié
laventure
un
instant
dans
le
fiacre
qui
le
menait
rue
richelieu
il
sétait
juré
de
ne
pas
retourner
chez
cette
femme
le
ciel
lui
donnait
un
avertissement
il
regardait
le
malheur
de
philippe
et
de
georges
comme
lannonce
de
sa
propre
perte
mais
ni
le
spectacle
de
madame
hugon
en
larmes
ni
la
vue
de
lenfant
brûlé
de
fièvre
navaient
eu
la
force
de
lui
faire
tenir
son
serment
et
du
court
frisson
de
ce
drame
il
lui
restait
seulement
la
jouissance
sourde
dêtre
débarrassé
dun
rival
dont
la
jeunesse
charmante
lavait
toujours
exaspéré
il
en
arrivait
maintenant
à
une
passion
exclusive
une
de
ces
passions
dhommes
qui
nont
pas
eu
de
jeunesse
il
aimait
nana
avec
un
besoin
de
la
savoir
à
lui
seul
de
lentendre
de
la
toucher
dêtre
dans
son
haleine
cétait
une
tendresse
élargie
audelà
des
sens
jusquau
sentiment
pur
une
affection
inquiète
jalouse
du
passé
rêvant
parfois
de
rédemption
de
pardon
reçu
tous
deux
agenouillés
devant
dieu
le
père
chaque
jour
la
religion
le
reprenait
davantage
il
pratiquait
de
nouveau
se
confessait
et
communiait
sans
cesse
combattu
doublant
de
ses
remords
les
joies
du
péché
et
de
la
pénitence
puis
son
directeur
lui
ayant
permis
duser
sa
passion
il
sétait
fait
une
habitude
de
cette
damnation
quotidienne
quil
rachetait
par
des
élans
de
foi
pleins
dune
humilité
dévote
très
naïvement
il
offrait
au
ciel
comme
une
souffrance
expiatrice
labominable
tourment
dont
il
souffrait
ce
tourment
grandissait
encore
il
montait
son
calvaire
de
croyant
de
coeur
grave
et
profond
tombé
dans
la
sensualité
enragée
dune
fille
et
ce
dont
il
agonisait
surtout
cétait
des
continuelles
infidélités
de
cette
femme
ne
pouvant
se
faire
au
partage
ne
comprenant
pas
ses
caprices
imbéciles
lui
souhaitait
un
amour
éternel
toujours
le
même
cependant
elle
avait
juré
et
il
la
payait
pour
ça
mais
il
la
sentait
menteuse
incapable
de
se
garder
se
donnant
aux
amis
aux
passants
en
bonne
bête
née
pour
vivre
sans
chemise
un
matin
quil
vit
sortir
foucarmont
de
chez
elle
à
une
heure
singulière
il
lui
fit
une
scène
du
coup
elle
se
fâcha
fatiguée
de
sa
jalousie
déjà
plusieurs
fois
elle
sétait
montrée
gentille
ainsi
le
soir
où
il
lavait
surprise
avec
georges
elle
était
revenue
la
première
avouant
ses
torts
le
comblant
de
caresses
et
de
mots
aimables
pour
lui
faire
avaler
ça
mais
à
la
fin
il
lassommait
avec
son
entêtement
à
ne
pas
comprendre
les
femmes
et
elle
fut
brutale
eh
bien
oui
jai
couché
avec
foucarmont
après
hein
ça
te
défrise
mon
petit
mufe
cétait
la
première
fois
quelle
lui
jetait
mon
petit
mufe
à
la
figure
il
restait
suffoqué
par
la
carrure
de
son
aveu
et
comme
il
serrait
les
poings
elle
marcha
vers
lui
le
regarda
en
face
en
voilà
assez
hein
si
ça
ne
te
convient
pas
tu
vas
faire
le
plaisir
de
sortir
je
ne
veux
pas
que
tu
cries
chez
moi
mets
bien
dans
ta
caboche
que
jentends
être
libre
quand
un
homme
plaît
je
couche
avec
parfaitement
cest
comme
ça
et
il
faut
te
décider
tout
de
suite
oui
ou
non
tu
peux
sortir
elle
était
allée
ouvrir
la
porte
il
ne
sortit
pas
maintenant
cétait
sa
façon
de
lattacher
davantage
pour
un
rien
à
la
moindre
querelle
elle
lui
mettait
le
marché
en
main
avec
des
réflexions
abominables
ah
bien
elle
trouverait
toujours
mieux
que
lui
elle
avait
lembarras
du
choix
ramassait
des
hommes
dehors
tant
quon
en
voulait
et
des
hommes
moins
godiches
dont
le
sang
bouillait
dans
les
veines
il
baissait
la
tête
il
attendait
des
heures
plus
douces
lorsquelle
avait
un
besoin
dargent
alors
elle
se
faisait
caressante
et
il
oubliait
une
nuit
de
tendresse
compensait
les
tortures
de
toute
une
semaine
son
rapprochement
avec
sa
femme
lui
avait
rendu
son
intérieur
insupportable
la
comtesse
lâchée
par
fauchery
qui
retombait
sous
lempire
de
rose
sétourdissait
à
dautres
amours
dans
le
coup
de
fièvre
inquiet
de
la
quarantaine
toujours
nerveuse
emplissant
lhôtel
du
tourbillon
exaspérant
de
sa
vie
estelle
depuis
son
mariage
ne
voyait
plus
son
père
chez
cette
fille
plate
et
insignifiante
une
femme
dune
volonté
de
fer
avait
brusquement
paru
si
absolue
que
daguenet
tremblait
devant
elle
maintenant
il
laccompagnait
à
la
messe
converti
furieux
contre
son
beaupère
qui
les
ruinait
avec
une
créature
seul
venot
restait
tendre
pour
le
comte
guettant
son
heure
même
il
en
était
arrivé
à
sintroduire
près
de
nana
il
fréquentait
les
deux
maisons
où
lon
rencontrait
derrière
les
portes
son
continuel
sourire
et
muffat
misérable
chez
lui
chassé
par
lennui
et
la
honte
préférait
encore
vivre
avenue
de
villiers
au
milieu
des
injures
bientôt
une
seule
question
demeura
entre
nana
et
le
comte
largent
un
jour
après
lui
avoir
promis
formellement
dix
mille
francs
il
avait
osé
se
présenter
les
mains
vides
à
lheure
convenue
depuis
lavantveille
elle
le
chauffait
de
caresses
un
tel
manque
de
parole
tant
de
gentillesses
perdues
la
jetèrent
dans
une
rage
de
grossièretés
elle
était
toute
blanche
hein
tu
nas
pas
la
monnaie
alors
mon
petit
mufe
retourne
doù
tu
viens
et
plus
vite
que
ça
en
voilà
un
chameau
il
voulait
membrasser
encore
plus
dargent
plus
rien
tu
entends
il
donnait
des
explications
il
aurait
la
somme
le
surlendemain
mais
elle
linterrompit
violemment
et
mes
échéances
saisira
moi
pendant
que
monsieur
viendra
ici
à
loeil
ah
ça
regardetoi
donc
estce
que
tu
timagines
que
je
taime
pour
tes
formes
quand
une
gueule
comme
la
tienne
paie
les
femmes
qui
veulent
bien
vous
tolérer
nom
de
dieu
si
tu
ne
mapportes
pas
les
dix
mille
francs
ce
soir
tu
nauras
pas
même
à
sucer
le
bout
de
mon
petit
doigt
vrai
je
te
renvoie
à
ta
femme
le
soir
il
apporta
les
dix
mille
francs
nana
tendit
les
lèvres
il
prit
un
long
baiser
qui
le
consola
de
toute
sa
journée
dangoisse
ce
qui
ennuyait
la
jeune
femme
cétait
de
lavoir
sans
cesse
dans
ses
jupes
elle
se
plaignait
à
venot
en
le
suppliant
demmener
son
petit
mufe
chez
la
comtesse
ça
ne
servait
donc
à
rien
leur
réconciliation
et
elle
regrettait
de
sêtre
mêlée
de
ça
puisquil
lui
retombait
quand
même
sur
le
dos
les
jours
où
de
colère
elle
oubliait
ses
intérêts
elle
jurait
de
lui
faire
une
telle
saleté
quil
ne
pourrait
remettre
les
pieds
chez
elle
mais
comme
elle
le
criait
en
se
tapant
sur
les
cuisses
elle
aurait
eu
beau
lui
cracher
à
la
figure
il
serait
resté
en
disant
merci
alors
continuellement
les
scènes
recommencèrent
pour
largent
elle
en
exigeait
avec
brutalité
cétaient
des
engueulades
au
sujet
de
sommes
misérables
une
avidité
odieuse
de
chaque
minute
une
cruauté
à
lui
répéter
quelle
couchait
avec
lui
pour
son
argent
pas
pour
autre
chose
et
que
ça
ne
lamusait
pas
et
quelle
en
aimait
un
autre
et
quelle
était
bien
malheureuse
davoir
besoin
dun
idiot
de
son
espèce
ne
voulait
même
plus
de
lui
à
la
cour
où
lon
parlait
dexiger
sa
démission
limpératrice
avait
dit
il
est
trop
dégoûtant
ça
cétait
bien
vrai
aussi
nana
répétait
le
mot
pour
clore
toutes
leurs
querelles
tiens
tu
dégoûtes
cette
heure
elle
ne
se
gênait
plus
elle
avait
reconquis
une
liberté
entière
tous
les
jours
elle
faisait
son
tour
du
lac
ébauchant
là
des
connaissances
qui
se
dénouaient
ailleurs
cétait
la
grande
retape
le
persil
au
clair
soleil
le
raccrochage
des
catins
illustres
étalées
dans
le
sourire
de
tolérance
et
dans
le
luxe
éclatant
de
paris
des
duchesses
se
la
montraient
dun
regard
des
bourgeoises
enrichies
copiaient
ses
chapeaux
parfois
son
landau
pour
passer
arrêtait
une
file
de
puissants
équipages
des
financiers
tenant
leurope
dans
leur
caisse
des
ministres
dont
les
gros
doigts
serraient
la
france
à
la
gorge
et
elle
était
de
ce
monde
du
bois
elle
prenait
une
place
considérable
connue
de
toutes
les
capitales
demandée
par
tous
les
étrangers
ajoutant
aux
splendeurs
de
cette
foule
le
coup
de
folie
de
sa
débauche
comme
la
gloire
même
et
la
jouissance
aiguë
dune
nation
puis
les
liaisons
dune
nuit
des
passades
continuelles
dont
ellemême

promenaient
dans
les

en

de
messieurs
écorchant
le

pour

prenant
à
la
soirée
avec
ordre
dêtre
drôles
si
blasés
et
si
vides
quils
ne
les
touchaient
même
pas
et
elles
appelaient
ça
aller
à
la
rigolade
elles
rentraient
heureuses
de
leurs
dédains
finir
la
nuit
aux
bras
de
quelque
amant
de
coeur
le
comte
muffat
feignait
dignorer
lorsquelle
ne
lui
jetait
pas
les
hommes
à
la
tête
il
souffrait
dailleurs
beaucoup
des
petites
hontes
de
lexistence
quotidienne
lhôtel
de
lavenue
de
villiers
devenait
un
enfer
une
maison
de
fous
où
des
détraquements
à
toute
heure
amenaient
des
crises
odieuses
nana
en
arrivait
à
se
battre
avec
ses
domestiques
un
instant
elle
se
montra
très
bonne
pour
charles
le
cocher
lorsquelle
sarrêtait
dans
un
restaurant
elle
lui
envoyait
des
bocks
par
un
garçon
elle
causait
de
lintérieur
de
son
landau
égayée
le
trouvant
cocasse
au
milieu
des
embarras
de
voitures
quand
il
sengueulait
avec
les
sapins
puis
sans
raison
elle
le
traita
didiot
toujours
elle
se
chamaillait
pour
la
paille
pour
le
son
pour
lavoine
malgré
son
amour
des
bêtes
elle
trouvait
que
ses
chevaux
mangeaient
trop
alors
un
jour
de
règlement
comme
elle
laccusait
de
la
voler
charles
semporta
et
lappela
salope
crûment
bien
sûr
ses
chevaux
valaient
mieux
quelle
ils
ne
couchaient
pas
avec
tout
le
monde
elle
répondit
sur
le
même
ton
le
comte
dut
les
séparer
et
mettre
le
cocher
à
la
porte
mais
ce
fut
le
commencement
dune
débâcle
parmi
les
domestiques
victorine
et
françois
partirent
à
la
suite
dun
vol
de
diamants
julien
luimême
disparut
et
une
histoire
courait
cétait
monsieur
qui
lavait
supplié
de
sen
aller
en
lui
donnant
une
grosse
somme
parce
quil
couchait
avec
madame
tous
les
huit
jours
voyait
à
loffice
des
figures
nouvelles
jamais
navait
tant
gâché
la
maison
était
comme
un
passage
où
le
rebut
des
bureaux
de
placement
défilait
dans
un
galop
de
massacre
zoé
seule
restait
avec
son
air
propre
et
son
unique
souci
dorganiser
ce
désordre
tant
quelle
naurait
pas
de
quoi
sétablir
pour
son
compte
un
plan
dont
elle
mûrissait
lidée
depuis
longtemps
et
ce
nétait
là
encore
que
les
soucis
avouables
le
comte
supportait
la
stupidité
de
madame
maloir
jouant
au
bézigue
avec
elle
malgré
son
odeur
de
rance
il
supportait
madame
lerat
et
ses
ragots
le
petit
louis
et
ses
plaintes
tristes
denfant
rongé
de
mal
quelque
pourriture
léguée
par
un
père
inconnu
mais
il
passait
des
heures
plus
mauvaises
un
soir
derrière
une
porte
il
avait
entendu
nana
raconter
furieusement
à
sa
femme
de
chambre
quun
prétendu
riche
venait
de
la
flouer
oui
un
bel
homme
qui
se
disait
américain
avec
des
mines
dor
dans
son
pays
un
salaud
qui
sen
était
allé
pendant
son
sommeil
sans
laisser
un
sou
en
emportant
même
un
cahier
de
papier
à
cigarettes
et
le
comte
très
pâle
avait
redescendu
lescalier
sur
la
pointe
des
pieds
pour
ne
pas
savoir
une
autre
fois
il
fut
forcé
de
tout
connaître
nana
toquée
dun
baryton
de
caféconcert
et
quittée
par
lui
rêva
de
suicide
dans
une
crise
de
sentimentalité
noire
elle
avala
un
verre
deau
où
elle
avait
fait
tremper
une
poignée
dallumettes
ce
qui
la
rendit
horriblement
malade
sans
la
tuer
le
comte
dut
la
soigner
et
subir
lhistoire
de
sa
passion
avec
des
larmes
des
serments
de
ne
plus
jamais
sattacher
aux
hommes
dans
son
mépris
de
ces
cochons
comme
elle
les
nommait
elle
ne
pouvait
pourtant
rester
le
coeur
libre
ayant
toujours
quelque
amant
de
coeur
sous
ses
jupes
roulant
aux
béguins
inexplicables
aux
goûts
pervers
des
lassitudes
de
son
corps
depuis
que
zoé
se
relâchait
par
calcul
la
bonne
administration
de
lhôtel
était
détraquée
au
point
que
muffat
nosait
pousser
une
porte
tirer
un
rideau
ouvrir
une
armoire
les
trucs
ne
fonctionnaient
plus
des
messieurs
traînaient
partout
se
cognait
à
chaque
instant
les
uns
dans
les
autres
maintenant
il
toussait
avant
dentrer
ayant
failli
trouver
la
jeune
femme
au
cou
de
francis
un
soir
quil
venait
de
sabsenter
deux
minutes
du
cabinet
de
toilette
pour
dire
datteler
pendant
que
le
coiffeur
donnait
à
madame
un
dernier
coup
de
peigne
cétaient
des
abandons
brusques
derrière
son
dos
du
plaisir
pris
dans
tous
les
coins
vivement
en
chemise
ou
en
grande
toilette
avec
le
premier
venu
elle
le
rejoignait
toute
rouge
heureuse
de
ce
vol
avec
lui
ça
lassommait
une
corvée
abominable
dans
langoisse
de
sa
jalousie
le
malheureux
en
arrivait
à
être
tranquille
lorsquil
laissait
nana
et
satin
ensemble
il
laurait
poussée
à
ce
vice
pour
écarter
les
hommes
mais
de
ce
côté
encore
tout
se
gâtait
nana
trompait
satin
comme
elle
trompait
le
comte
senrageant
dans
des
toquades
monstrueuses
ramassant
des
filles
au
coin
des
bornes
quand
elle
rentrait
en
voiture
elle
samourachait
parfois
dun
souillon
aperçu
sur
le
pavé
les
sens
pris
limagination
lâchée
et
elle
faisait
monter
le
souillon
le
payait
et
le
renvoyait
puis
sous
un
déguisement
dhomme
cétaient
des
parties
dans
des
maisons
infâmes
des
spectacles
de
débauche
dont
elle
amusait
son
ennui
et
satin
irritée
dêtre
lâchée
continuellement
bouleversait
lhôtel
de
scènes
atroces
elle
avait
fini
par
prendre
un
empire
absolu
sur
nana
qui
la
respectait
muffat
rêva
même
une
alliance
quand
il
nosait
pas
il
déchaînait
satin
deux
fois
elle
avait
forcé
sa
chérie
à
le
reprendre
tandis
que
lui
se
montrait
obligeant
lavertissait
et
seffaçait
devant
elle
au
moindre
signe
seulement
lentente
ne
durait
guère
satin
était
fêlée
elle
aussi
certains
jours
elle
cassait
tout
crevée
à
moitié
sabîmant
à
des
rages
de
colère
et
de
tendresse
jolie
quand
même
zoé
devait
lui
monter
la
tête
car
elle
la
prenait
dans
les
coins
comme
si
elle
avait
voulu
lembaucher
pour
sa
grande
affaire
ce
plan
dont
elle
ne
parlait
encore
à
personne
cependant
des
révoltes
singulières
redressaient
encore
le
comte
muffat
lui
qui
tolérait
satin
depuis
des
mois
qui
avait
fini
par
accepter
les
inconnus
tout
ce
troupeau
dhommes
galopant
au
travers
de
lalcôve
de
nana
semportait
à
lidée
dêtre
trompé
par
quelquun
de
son
monde
ou
simplement
de
sa
connaissance
quand
elle
lui
avoua
ses
rapports
avec
foucarmont
il
souffrit
tellement
il
trouva
la
trahison
du
jeune
homme
si
abominable
quil
voulut
le
provoquer
et
se
battre
comme
il
ne
savait
où
chercher
des
témoins
dans
une
pareille
affaire
il
sadressa
à
labordette
celuici
stupéfait
ne
put
sempêcher
de
rire
un
duel
pour
nana
mais
cher
monsieur
tout
paris
se
moquerait
de
vous
ne
se
bat
pas
pour
nana
cest
ridicule
le
comte
devint
très
pâle
il
eut
un
geste
de
violence
alors
je
le
souffletterai
en
pleine
rue
pendant
une
heure
labordette
dut
le
raisonner
un
soufflet
rendrait
lhistoire
odieuse
le
soir
tout
le
monde
saurait
la
véritable
cause
de
la
rencontre
il
serait
la
fable
des
journaux
et
labordette
revenait
toujours
à
cette
conclusion
impossible
cest
ridicule
chaque
fois
cette
parole
tombait
sur
muffat
nette
et
tranchante
comme
un
coup
de
couteau
il
ne
pouvait
même
se
battre
pour
la
femme
quil
aimait
aurait
éclaté
de
rire
jamais
il
navait
senti
plus
douloureusement
la
misère
de
son
amour
cette
gravité
de
son
coeur
perdue
dans
cette
blague
du
plaisir
ce
fut
sa
dernière
révolte
il
se
laissa
convaincre
il
assista
dès
lors
au
défilé
des
amis
de
tous
les
hommes
qui
vivaient
là
dans
lintimité
de
lhôtel
nana
en
quelques
mois
les
mangea
goulûment
les
uns
après
les
autres
les
besoins
croissants
de
son
luxe
enrageaient
ses
appétits
elle
nettoyait
un
homme
dun
coup
de
dent
dabord
elle
eut
foucarmont
qui
ne
dura
pas
quinze
jours
il
rêvait
de
quitter
la
marine
il
avait
amassé
en
dix
années
de
voyages
une
trentaine
de
mille
francs
quil
voulait
risquer
aux
étatsunis
et
ses
instincts
de
prudence
davarice
même
furent
emportés
il
donna
tout
jusqu
à
des
signatures
sur
des
billets
de
complaisance
engageant
son
avenir
lorsque
nana
le
poussa
dehors
il
était
nu
dailleurs
elle
se
montra
très
bonne
elle
lui
conseilla
de
retourner
sur
son
bateau
quoi
bon
sentêter
puisquil
navait
pas
dargent
ce
nétait
plus
possible
il
devait
comprendre
et
se
montrer
raisonnable
un
homme
ruiné
tombait
de
ses
mains
comme
un
fruit
mûr
pour

ensuite
nana
se
mit
sur
steiner
sans
dégoût
mais
sans
tendresse
elle
le
traitait
de
sale
juif
elle
semblait
assouvir
une
haine
ancienne
dont
elle
ne
se
rendait
pas
bien
compte
il
était
gros
il
était
bête
et
elle
le
bousculait
avalant
les
morceaux
doubles
voulant
en
finir
plus
vite
avec
ce
prussien
lui
avait
lâché
simonne
son
affaire
du
bosphore
commençait
à
péricliter
nana
précipita
lécroulement
par
des
exigences
folles
pendant
un
mois
encore
il
se
débattit
faisant
des
miracles
il
emplissait
leurope
dune
publicité
colossale
affiches
annonces
prospectus
et
tirait
de
largent
des
pays
les
plus
lointains
toute
cette
épargne
les
louis
des
spéculateurs
comme
les
sous
des
pauvres
gens
sengouffrait
avenue
de
villiers
dautre
part
il
sétait
associé
avec
un
maître
de
forges
en
alsace
il
avait
làbas
dans
un
coin
de
province
des
ouvriers
noirs
de
charbon
trempés
de
sueur
qui
nuit
et
jour
raidissaient
leurs
muscles
et
entendaient
craquer
leurs
os
pour
suffire
aux
plaisirs
de
nana
elle
dévorait
tout
comme
un
grand
feu
les
vols
de
lagio
les
gains
du
travail
cette
fois
elle
finit
steiner
elle
le
rendit
au
pavé
sucé
jusquaux
moelles
si
vidé
quil
resta
même
incapable
dinventer
une
coquinerie
nouvelle
dans
leffondrement
de
sa
maison
de
banque
il
bégayait
il
tremblait
à
lidée
de
la
police
venait
de
le
déclarer
en
faillite
et
le
seul
mot
dargent
lahurissait
le
jetait
dans
un
embarras
denfant
lui
qui
avait
remué
des
millions
un
soir
chez
elle
il
se
mit
à
pleurer
il
lui
demanda
un
emprunt
de
cent
francs
pour
payer
sa
bonne
et
nana
attendrie
et
égayée
par
cette
fin
du
terrible
bonhomme
qui
écumait
la
place
de
paris
depuis
vingt
années
les
lui
apporta
en
disant
tu
sais
je
te
les
donne
parce
que
cest
drôle
mais
écoute
mon
petit
tu
nas
plus
lâge
pour
que
je
tentretienne
faut
chercher
une
autre
occupation
alors
nana
tout
de
suite
entama
la
faloise
il
postulait
depuis
longtemps
lhonneur
dêtre
ruiné
par
elle
afin
dêtre
parfaitement
chic
cela
lui
manquait
il
fallait
quune
femme
le
lançât
en
deux
mois
paris
le
connaîtrait
et
il
lirait
son
nom
dans
les
journaux
six
semaines
suffirent
son
héritage
était
en
propriétés
des
terres
des
prairies
des
bois
des
fermes
il
dut
vendre
rapidement
coup
sur
coup
chaque
bouchée
nana
dévorait
un
arpent
les
feuillages
frissonnant
sous
le
soleil
les
grands
blés
mûrs
les
vignes
dorées
en
septembre
les
herbes
hautes
où
les
vaches
enfonçaient
jusquau
ventre
tout
passait
dans
un
engloutissement
dabîme
et
il
eut
même
un
cours
deau
une
carrière
à
plâtre
trois
moulins
qui
disparurent
nana
passait
pareille
à
une
invasion
à
une
de
ces
nuées
de
sauterelles
dont
le
vol
de
flamme
rase
une
province
elle
brûlait
la
terre
où
elle
posait
son
petit
pied
ferme
à
ferme
prairie
à
prairie
elle
croqua
lhéritage
de
son
air
gentil
sans
même
sen
apercevoir
comme
elle
croquait
entre
ses
repas
un
sac
de
pralines
posé
sur
ses
genoux
ça
ne
tirait
pas
à
conséquence
cétaient
des
bonbons
mais
un
soir
il
ne
resta
quun
petit
bois
elle
lavala
dun
air
de
dédain
car
ça
ne
valait
même
pas
la
peine
douvrir
la
bouche
la
faloise
avait
un
rire
idiot
en
suçant
la
pomme
de
sa
canne
la
dette
lécrasait
il
ne
possédait
plus
cent
francs
de
rente
il
se
voyait
forcé
de
retourner
en
province
vivre
chez
un
oncle
maniaque
mais
ça
ne
faisait
rien
il
était
chic
le
figaro
avait
imprimé
deux
fois
son
nom
et
le
cou
maigre
entre
les
pointes
rabattues
de
son
faux
col
la
taille
cassée
sous
un
veston
trop
court
il
se
dandinait
avec
des
exclamations
de
perruche
et
des
lassitudes
affectées
de
pantin
de
bois
qui
n
jamais
eu
une
émotion
nana
quil
agaçait
finit
par
le
battre
cependant
fauchery
était
revenu
amené
par
son
cousin
ce
malheureux
fauchery
à
cette
heure
avait
un
ménage
après
avoir
rompu
avec
la
comtesse
il
se
trouvait
aux
mains
de
rose
qui
usait
de
lui
comme
dun
mari
véritable
mignon
demeurait
simplement
le
majordome
de
madame
installé
en
maître
le
journaliste
mentait
à
rose
prenait
toutes
sortes
de
précautions
lorsquil
la
trompait
plein
des
scrupules
dun
bon
époux
désireux
de
se
ranger
enfin
le
triomphe
de
nana
fut
de
lavoir
et
de
lui
manger
un
journal
quil
avait
fondé
avec
largent
dun
ami
elle
ne
laffichait
pas
se
plaisait
au
contraire
à
le
traiter
en
monsieur
qui
doit
se
cacher
et
quand
elle
parlait
de
rose
elle
disait
cette
pauvre
rose
le
journal
lui
donna
des
fleurs
pendant
deux
mois
elle
avait
des
abonnés
en
province
elle
prenait
tout
depuis
la
chronique
jusquaux
échos
de
théâtre
puis
après
avoir
essoufflé
la
rédaction
disloqué
ladministration
elle
contenta
un
gros
caprice
un
jardin
dhiver
dans
un
coin
de
son
hôtel
qui
emporta
limprimerie
dailleurs
cétait
simplement
histoire
de
plaisanter
quand
mignon
heureux
de
laventure
accourut
voir
sil
ne
pourrait
pas
lui
coller
fauchery
tout
à
fait
elle
demanda
sil
se
moquait
delle
un
gaillard
sans
le
sou
vivant
de
ses
articles
et
de
ses
pièces
non
par
exemple
cette
bêtiselà
était
bonne
pour
une
femme
de
talent
comme
cette
pauvre
rose
et
se
méfiant
craignant
quelque
traîtrise
de
la
part
de
mignon
très
capable
de
les
dénoncer
à
sa
femme
elle
congédia
fauchery
qui
ne
la
payait
plus
quen
publicité
mais
elle
lui
gardait
un
bon
souvenir
ils
sétaient
bien
amusés
ensemble
de
cet
idiot
de
la
faloise
jamais
peutêtre
ils
nauraient
eu
lidée
de
se
revoir
si
le
plaisir
de
se
ficher
dun
pareil
crétin
ne
les
eût
excités
ça
leur
semblait
farce
ils
sembrassaient
sous
son
nez
ils
faisaient
une
noce
à
tout
casser
avec
son
argent
ils
lenvoyaient
en
course
au
bout
de
paris
pour
rester
seuls
puis
quand
il
revenait
cétaient
des
blagues
des
allusions
quil
ne
pouvait
comprendre
un
jour
poussée
par
le
journaliste
elle
paria
quelle
donnerait
un
soufflet
à
la
faloise
le
soir
même
elle
lui
donna
un
soufflet
puis
continua
de
le
battre
trouvant
ça
drôle
heureuse
de
montrer
combien
les
hommes
étaient
lâches
elle
lappelait
son
tiroir
à
claques
lui
disait
davancer
pour
recevoir
sa
gifle
des
gifles
qui
lui
rougissaient
la
main
parce
quelle
navait
pas
encore
lhabitude
la
faloise
riait
de
son
air
crevé
avec
des
larmes
dans
les
yeux
cette
familiarité
lenchantait
il
la
trouvait
épatante
tu
ne
sais
pas
ditil
un
soir
après
avoir
reçu
des
calottes
très
allumé
tu
devrais
mépouser
hein

nétait

sournoisement
projeté

du
besoin

apothéose

ils
se
mettent
aussitôt
à
chanter

elle
se
montait
puis
elle
éclata
avec
une
belle
indignation

faite

cette
machine

homme
sur
le
dos
et
dailleurs
cest
trop
sale
et
elle
crachait
elle
avait
un
hoquet
de
dégoût
comme
si
elle
avait
vu
sélargir
sous
elle
la
saleté
de
toute
la
terre
un
soir
la
faloise
disparut
apprit
huit
jours
plus
tard
quil
était
en
province
chez
son
oncle
qui
avait
la
manie
dherboriser
il
lui
collait
ses
herbiers
et
courait
la
chance
dépouser
une
cousine
très
laide
et
très
dévote
nana
ne
le
pleura
guère
elle
dit
simplement
au
comte
hein
mon
petit
mufe
encore
un
rival
de
moins
tu
jubiles
aujourdhui
mais
cest
quil
devenait
sérieux
il
voulait
mépouser
comme
il
pâlissait
elle
se
pendit
à
son
cou
en
riant
en
lui
enfonçant
dune
caresse
chacune
de
ses
cruautés
nestce
pas
cest
ça
qui
te
chiffonne
toi
tu
ne
peux
plus
épouser
nana
quand
ils
sont
tous
à
membêter
avec
leur
mariage
tu
rages
dans
ton
coin
pas
possible
il
faut
attendre
que
ta
femme
claque
ah
si
ta
femme
claquait
comme
tu
viendrais
vite
comme
tu
te
jetterais
par
terre
comme
tu
moffrirais
ça
avec
le
grand
jeu
les
soupirs
les
larmes
les
serments
hein
chéri
ce
serait
si
bon
elle
avait
pris
une
voix
douce
elle
le
blaguait
dun
air
de
câlinerie
féroce
lui
très
ému
se
mit
à
rougir
en
lui
rendant
ses
baisers
alors
elle
cria
nom
de
dieu
dire
que
jai
deviné
il
songé
il
attend
que
sa
femme
crève
ah
bien
cest
le
comble
il
est
encore
plus
coquin
que
les
autres
muffat
avait
accepté
les
autres
maintenant
il
mettait
sa
dernière
dignité
à
rester
monsieur
pour
les
domestiques
et
les
familiers
de
la
maison
lhomme
qui
donnant
le
plus
était
lamant
officiel
et
sa
passion
sacharnait
il
se
maintenait
en
payant
achetant
très
cher
jusquaux
sourires
volé
même
et
nen
ayant
jamais
pour
son
argent
mais
cétait
comme
une
maladie
qui
le
rongeait
il
ne
pouvait
sempêcher
den
souffrir
lorsquil
entrait
dans
la
chambre
de
nana
il
se
contentait
douvrir
un
instant
les
fenêtres
afin
de
chasser
lodeur
des
autres
des
effluves
de
blonds
et
de
bruns
des
fumées
de
cigare
dont
lâcreté
le
suffoquait
cette
chambre
devenait
un
carrefour
continuellement
des
bottes
sessuyaient
sur
le
seuil
et
pas
un
nétait
arrêté
par
le
trait
de
sang
qui
barrait
la
porte
zoé
avait
gardé
une
préoccupation
de
cette
tache
une
simple
manie
de
fille
propre
agacée
de
la
voir
toujours
là
ses
yeux
portaient
quand
même
elle
nentrait
plus
chez
madame
sans
dire
cest
drôle
ça
ne
sen
va
pas
il
vient
pourtant
assez
de
monde
nana
qui
recevait
de
meilleures
nouvelles
de
georges
alors
en
convalescence
aux
fondettes
avec
sa
mère
faisait
chaque
fois
la
même
réponse
ah
dame
il
faut
le
temps
ça
pâlit
sous
les
pieds
en
effet
chacun
de
ces
messieurs
foucarmont
steiner
la
faloise
fauchery
avait
emporté
un
peu
de
la
tache
à
ses
semelles
et
muffat
que
le
trait
de
sang
préoccupait
comme
zoé
létudiait
malgré
lui
pour
lire
dans
son
effacement
de
plus
en
plus
rose
le
nombre
dhommes
qui
passaient
il
en
avait
une
sourde
peur
toujours
il
lenjambait
par
une
crainte
brusque
décraser
quelque
chose
de
vivant
un
membre
nu
étalé
par
terre
puis
là
dans
cette
chambre
un
vertige
le
grisait
il
oubliait
tout
la
cohue
des
mâles
qui
la
traversaient
le
deuil
qui
en
fermait
la
porte
dehors
parfois
au
grand
air
de
la
rue
il
pleurait
de
honte
et
de
révolte
en
jurant
de
ne
jamais
rentrer
et
dès
que
la
portière
retombait
il
était
repris
il
se
sentait
fondre
à
la
tiédeur
de
la
pièce
la
chair
pénétrée
dun
parfum
envahie
dun
désir
voluptueux
danéantissement
lui
dévot
habitué
aux
extases
des
chapelles
riches
retrouvait
exactement
ses
sensations
de
croyant
lorsque
agenouillé
sous
un
vitrail
il
succombait
à
livresse
des
orgues
et
des
encensoirs
la
femme
le
possédait
avec
le
despotisme
jaloux
dun
dieu
de
colère
le
terrifiant
lui
donnant
des
secondes
de
joie
aiguës
comme
des
spasmes
pour
des
heures
daffreux
tourments
des
visions
denfer
et
déternels
supplices
cétaient
les
mêmes
balbutiements
les
mêmes
prières
et
les
mêmes
désespoirs
surtout
les
mêmes
humilités
dune
créature
maudite
écrasée
sous
la
boue
de
son
origine
ses
désirs
dhomme
ses
besoins
dune
âme
se
confondaient
semblaient
monter
du
fond
obscur
de
son
être
ainsi
quun
seul
épanouissement
du
tronc
de
la
vie
il
sabandonnait
à
la
force
de
lamour
et
de
la
foi
dont
le
double
levier
soulève
le
monde
et
toujours
malgré
les
luttes
de
sa
raison
cette
chambre
de
nana
le
frappait
de
folie
il
disparaissait
en
grelottant
dans
la
toutepuissance
du
sexe
comme
il
sévanouissait
devant
linconnu
du
vaste
ciel
alors
quand
elle
le
sentit
si
humble
nana
eut
le
triomphe
tyrannique
elle
apportait
dinstinct
la
rage
davilir
il
ne
lui
suffisait
pas
de
détruire
les
choses
elle
les
salissait
ses
mains
si
fines
laissaient
des
traces
abominables
décomposaient
dellesmêmes
tout
ce
quelles
avaient
cassé
et
lui
imbécile
se
prêtait
à
ce
jeu
avec
le
vague
souvenir
des
saints
dévorés
de
poux
et
qui
mangeaient
leurs
excréments
lorsquelle
le
tenait
dans
sa
chambre
les
portes
closes
elle
se
donnait
le
régal
de
linfamie
de
lhomme
dabord
ils
avaient
plaisanté
elle
lui
allongeait
de
légères
tapes
lui
imposait
des
volontés
drôles
le
faisait
zézayer
comme
un
enfant
répéter
des
fins
de
phrase
dis
comme
moi
et
zut
coco
sen
fiche
il
se
montrait
docile
jusqu
à
reproduire
son
accent
et
zut
coco
sen
fiche
ou
bien
elle
faisait
lours
à
quatre
pattes
sur
ses
fourrures
en
chemise
tournant
avec
des
grognements
comme
si
elle
avait
voulu
le
dévorer
et
même
elle
lui
mordillait
les
mollets
pour
rire
puis
se
relevant
toi
fais
un
peu
je
parie
que
tu
ne
fais
pas
lours
comme
moi
cétait
encore
charmant
elle
lamusait
en
avec
sa
peau
blanche
et
sa
crinière
de
poils
roux
il
riait
il
se
mettait
aussi
à
quatre
pattes
grognait
lui
mordait
les
mollets
pendant
quelle
se
sauvait
en
affectant
des
mines
deffroi
sommesnous
bêtes
hein
finissaitelle
par
dire
tu
nas
pas
idée
comme
tu
es
laid
mon
chat
ah
bien
si
te
voyait
aux
tuileries
mais
ces
petits
jeux
se
gâtèrent
bientôt
ce
ne
fut
pas
cruauté
chez
elle
car
elle
demeurait
bonne
fille
ce
fut
comme
un
vent
de
démence
qui
passa
et
grandit
peu
à
peu
dans
la
chambre
close
une
luxure
les
détraquait
les
jetait
aux
imaginations
délirantes
de
la
chair
les
anciennes
épouvantes
dévotes
de
leur
nuit
dinsomnie
tournaient
maintenant
en
une
soif
de
bestialité
une
fureur
de
se
mettre
à
quatre
pattes
de
grogner
et
de
mordre
puis
un
jour
comme
il
faisait
lours
elle
le
poussa
si
rudement
quil
tomba
contre
un
meuble
et
elle
éclata
dun
rire
involontaire
en
lui
voyant
une
bosse
au
front
dès
lors
mise
en
goût
par
son
essai
sur
la
faloise
elle
le
traita
en
animal
le
fouailla
le
poursuivit
à
coups
de
pied
hue
donc
hue
donc
tu
es
le
cheval
dia
hue
sale
rosse
veuxtu
marcher
dautres
fois
il
était
un
chien
elle
lui
jetait
son
mouchoir
parfumé
au
bout
de
la
pièce
et
il
devait
courir
le
ramasser
avec
les
dents
en
se
traînant
sur
les
mains
et
les
genoux
rapporte
césar
attends
je
vais
te
régaler
si
tu
flânes
très
bien
césar
obéissant
gentil
fais
le
beau
et
lui
aimait
sa
bassesse
goûtait
la
jouissance
dêtre
une
brute
il
aspirait
encore
à
descendre
il
criait
tape
plus
fort
hou
hou
je
suis
enragé
tape
donc
elle
fut
prise
dun
caprice
elle
exigea
quil
vînt
un
soir
vêtu
de
son
grand
costume
de
chambellan
alors
ce
furent
des
rires
des
moqueries
quand
elle
leut
dans
son
apparat
avec
lépée
le
chapeau
la
culotte
blanche
le
frac
de
drap
rouge
chamarré
dor
portant
la
clef
symbolique
pendue
sur
la
basque
gauche
cette
clef
surtout
légayait
la
lançait
à
une
fantaisie
folle
dexplications
ordurières
riant
toujours
emportée
par
lirrespect
des
grandeurs
par
la
joie
de
lavilir
sous
la
pompe
officielle
de
ce
costume
elle
le
secoua
le
pinça
en
lui
jetant
des
eh
va
donc
chambellan
quelle
accompagna
enfin
de
longs
coups
de
pied
dans
le
derrière
et
ces
coups
de
pied
elle
les
allongeait
de
si
bon
coeur
dans
les
tuileries
dans
la
majesté
de
la
cour
impériale
trônant
au
sommet
sur
la
peur
et
laplatissement
de
tous
voilà
ce
quelle
pensait
de
la
société
cétait
sa
revanche
une
rancune
inconsciente
de
famille
léguée
avec
le
sang
puis
le
chambellan
déshabillé
lhabit
étalé
par
terre
elle
lui
cria
de
sauter
et
il
sauta
elle
lui
cria
de
cracher
et
il
cracha
elle
lui
cria
de
marcher
sur
lor
sur
les
aigles
sur
les
décorations
et
il
marcha
patatras
il
n
avait
plus
rien
tout
seffondrait
elle
cassait
un
chambellan
comme
elle
cassait
un
flacon
ou
un
drageoir
et
elle
en
faisait
une
ordure
un
tas
de
boue
au
coin
dune
borne
cependant
les
orfèvres
avaient
manqué
de
parole
le
lit
ne
fut
livré
que
vers
le
milieu
de
janvier
muffat
justement
se
trouvait
en
normandie
où
il
était
allé
pour
vendre
une
dernière
épave
nana
exigeait
quatre
mille
francs
tout
de
suite
il
ne
devait
revenir
que
le
surlendemain
mais
ayant
terminé
laffaire
il
hâta
son
retour
et
sans
même
passer
rue
miromesnil
se
rendit
avenue
de
villiers
dix
heures
sonnaient
comme
il
avait
une
clef
dune
petite
porte
ouvrant
sur
la
rue
cardinet
il
monta
librement
en
haut
dans
le
salon
zoé
qui
essuyait
les
bronzes
resta
saisie
et
ne
sachant
comment
larrêter
elle
se
mit
à
lui
conter
en
longues
phrases
que
venot
lair
bouleversé
le
cherchait
depuis
la
veille
quil
était
déjà
venu
deux
fois
la
supplier
de
renvoyer
monsieur
chez
lui
si
monsieur
descendait
dabord
chez
madame
muffat
lécoutait
ne
comprenant
rien
à
cette
histoire
puis
il
remarqua
son
trouble
et
pris
tout
à
coup
dune
rage
jalouse
dont
il
ne
se
croyait
plus
capable
il
se
jeta
dans
la
porte
de
la
chambre
où
il
entendait
des
rires
la
porte
céda
les
deux
battants
volèrent
pendant
que
zoé
se
retirait
avec
un
haussement
dépaules
tant
pis
puisque
madame
devenait
folle
madame
sarrangerait
toute
seule
et
muffat
sur
le
seuil
eut
un
cri
devant
la
chose
quil
voyait
mon
dieu
mon
dieu
dans
son
luxe
royal
la
nouvelle
chambre
resplendissait
des
capitons
dargent
semaient
détoiles
vives
le
velours
rose
thé
de
la
tenture
de
ce
rose
de
chair
que
le
ciel
prend
par
les
beaux
soirs
lorsque
vénus
sallume
à
lhorizon
sur
le
fond
clair
du
jour
qui
se
meurt
tandis
que
les
cordelières
dor
tombant
des
angles
les
dentelles
dor
encadrant
les
panneaux
étaient
comme
des
flammes
légères
des
chevelures
rousses
dénouées
couvrant
à
demi
la
grande
nudité
de
la
pièce
dont
elles
rehaussaient
la
pâleur
voluptueuse
puis
en
face
cétait
le
lit
dor
et
dargent
qui
rayonnait
avec
léclat
neuf
de
ses
ciselures
un
trône
assez
large
pour
que
nana
pût
étendre
la
royauté
de
ses
membres
nus
un
autel
dune
richesse
byzantine
digne
de
la
toutepuissance
de
son
sexe
et
où
elle
létalait
à
cette
heure
même
découvert
dans
une
religieuse
impudeur
didole
redoutée
et
près
delle
sous
le
reflet
de
neige
de
sa
gorge
au
milieu
de
son
triomphe
de
déesse
se
vautrait
une
honte
une
décrépitude
une
ruine
comique
et
lamentable
le
marquis
de
chouard
en
chemise
le
comte
avait
joint
les
mains
traversé
dun
grand
frisson
il
répétait
mon
dieu
mon
dieu
cétait
pour
le
marquis
de
chouard
que
fleurissaient
les
roses
dor
du
bateau
des
touffes
de
roses

épanouies
dans
des
feuillages
dor
cétait
pour
lui
que
se
penchaient
les
amours
la
ronde
culbutée
sur
un
treillis
dargent
avec
des
rires
de
gaminerie
amoureuse
et
à
ses
pieds
le
faune
découvrait
pour
lui
le
sommeil
de
la
nymphe
lasse
de
volupté
cette
figure
de
la
nuit
copiée
sur
le
nu
célèbre
de
nana
jusque
dans
les
cuisses
trop
fortes
qui
la
faisaient
reconnaître
de
tous
jeté
là
comme
une
loque
humaine
gâtée
et
dissoute
par
soixante
ans
de
débauche
il
mettait
un
coin
de
charnier
dans
la
gloire
des
chairs
éclatantes
de
la
femme
quand
il
avait
vu
la
porte
souvrir
il
sétait
soulevé
pris
de
lépouvante
dun
vieillard
gâteux
cette
dernière
nuit
damour
le
frappait
dimbécillité
il
retombait
en
enfance
et
ne
trouvant
plus
les
mots
à
moitié
paralysé
bégayant
grelottant
il
restait
dans
une
attitude
de
fuite
la
chemise
retroussée
sur
son
corps
de
squelette
une
jambe
hors
des
couvertures
une
pauvre
jambe
livide
couverte
de
poils
gris
nana
malgré
sa
contrariété
ne
put
sempêcher
de
rire
couchetoi
donc
fourretoi
dans
le
lit
ditelle
en
le
renversant
et
en
lenterrant
sous
le
drap
comme
une
ordure
quon
ne
peut
montrer
et
elle
sauta
pour
refermer
la
porte
pas
de
chance
décidément
avec
son
petit
mufe
il
tombait
toujours
mal
à
propos
aussi
pourquoi
allaitil
chercher
de
largent
en
normandie
le
vieux
lui
avait
apporté
ses
quatre
mille
francs
et
elle
sétait
laissé
faire
elle
repoussa
les
battants
de
la
porte
elle
cria
tant
pis
cest
ta
faute
estce
quon
entre
comme
cela
en
voilà
assez
bon
voyage
muffat
demeurait
devant
cette
porte
fermée
dans
le
foudroiement
de
ce
quil
venait
de
voir
son
frisson
grandissait
un
frisson
qui
lui
montait
des
jambes
dans
la
poitrine
et
dans
le
crâne
puis
comme
un
arbre
secoué
par
un
grand
vent
il
chancela
il
sabattit
sur
les
genoux
avec
un
craquement
de
tous
les
membres
et
les
mains
désespérément
tendues
il
balbutia
cest
trop
mon
dieu
cest
trop
il
avait
tout
accepté
mais
il
ne
pouvait
plus
il
se
sentait
à
bout
de
force
dans
ce
noir
où
lhomme
culbute
avec
sa
raison
dun
élan
extraordinaire
les
mains
toujours
plus
hautes
il
cherchait
le
ciel
il
appelait
dieu
oh
non
je
ne
veux
pas
oh
venez
à
moi
mon
dieu
secourezmoi
faitesmoi
mourir
plutôt
oh
non
pas
cet
homme
mon
dieu
cest
fini
prenezmoi
emportezmoi
que
je
ne
voie
plus
que
je
ne
sente
plus
oh
je
vous
appartiens
mon
dieu
notre
père
qui
êtes
au
ciel
et
il
continuait
brûlant
de
foi
et
une
oraison
ardente
séchappait
de
ses
lèvres
mais
quelquun
le
touchait
à
lépaule
il
leva
les
yeux
cétait
venot
surpris
de
le
trouver
en
prière
devant
cette
porte
close
alors
comme
si
dieu
luimême
eût
répondu
à
son
appel
le
comte
se
jeta
au
cou
du
petit
vieillard
il
pouvait
pleurer
enfin
il
sanglotait
il
répétait
mon
frère
mon
frère
toute
son
humanité
souffrante
se
soulageait
dans
ce
cri
il
trempait
de
ses
larmes
le
visage
de
venot
il
le
baisait
avec
des
paroles
entrecoupées
mon
frère
que
je
souffre
vous
seul
restez
mon
frère
emmenezmoi
pour
toujours
oh
de
grâce
emmenezmoi
alors
venot
le
serra
sur
sa
poitrine
il
lappelait
aussi
son
frère
mais
il
avait
un
nouveau
coup
à
lui
porter
depuis
la
veille
il
le
cherchait
pour
lui
apprendre
que
la
comtesse
sabine
dans
un
détraquement
suprême
venait
de
senfuir
avec
un
chef
de
rayon
dun
grand
magasin
de
nouveautés
scandale
affreux
dont
tout
paris
causait
déjà
en
le
voyant
sous
linfluence
dune
telle
exaltation
religieuse
il
sentit
le
moment
favorable
il
lui
conta
tout
de
suite
laventure
cette
fin
platement
tragique
où
sombrait
sa
maison
le
comte
nen
fut
pas
touché
sa
femme
était
partie
ça
ne
lui
disait
rien
verrait
plus
tard
et
repris
dangoisse
regardant
la
porte
les
murs
le
plafond
dun
air
de
terreur
il
navait
toujours
que
cette
supplication
emmenezmoi
je
ne
peux
plus
emmenezmoi
venot
lemmena
comme
un
enfant
dès
lors
il
lui
appartint
tout
entier
muffat
retomba
dans
les
stricts
devoirs
de
la
religion
sa
vie
était
foudroyée
il
avait
donné
sa
démission
de
chambellan
devant
les
pudeurs
révoltées
des
tuileries
estelle
sa
fille

intentait
un
procès
pour
une
somme
de
soixante
mille
francs
lhéritage
dune
tante
quelle
aurait
dû
toucher
à
son
mariage
ruiné
vivant
étroitement
avec
les
débris
de
sa
grande
fortune
il
se
laissait
peu
à
peu
achever
par
la
comtesse
qui
mangeait
les
restes
dédaignés
de
nana
sabine
gâtée
par
la
promiscuité
de
cette
fille
poussée
à
tout

leffondrement
final
la
moisissure

du
foyer
après
des
aventures

était
rentrée
et
il
lavait
reprise
dans
la
résignation
du
pardon
chrétien
elle
laccompagnait
comme
sa
honte
vivante
mais
lui
de
plus
en
plus
indifférent
arrivait
à
ne
pas
souffrir
de
ces
choses
le
ciel
lenlevait
des
mains
de
la
femme
pour
le
remettre
aux
bras
mêmes
de
dieu
cétait
un
prolongement
religieux
des
voluptés
de
nana
avec
les
balbutiements
les
prières
et
les
désespoirs
les
humilités
dune
créature
maudite
écrasée
sous
la
boue
de
son
origine
au
fond
des
églises
les
genoux
glacés
par
les
dalles
il
retrouvait
ses
jouissances
dautrefois
les
spasmes
de
ses
muscles
et
les
ébranlements
délicieux
de
son
intelligence
dans
une
même
satisfaction
des
obscurs
besoins
de
son
être
le
soir
de
la
rupture
mignon
se
présenta
avenue
de
villiers
il
saccoutumait
à
fauchery
il
finissait
par
trouver
mille
avantages
dans
la
présence
dun
mari
chez

reposait
sur

de

dramatiques
et
comme
dautre
part
fauchery
se
montrait
raisonnable
sans
jalousie
ridicule
aussi
coulant
que
mignon
luimême
sur
les
occasions
trouvées
par
rose
les
deux
hommes
sentendaient
de
mieux
en
mieux
heureux
de
leur
association
fertile
en
bonheurs
de
toutes
sortes
faisant
chacun
son
trou
côte

ça
marchait
très
bien
ils
rivalisaient
lun

pour
la
félicité

justement
mignon
venait
sur
le
conseil
de
fauchery
voir
sil
ne
pourrait
pas
enlever
à
nana
sa
femme
de
chambre
dont
le
journaliste
avait
apprécié
lintelligence
hors
ligne
rose
était
désolée
elle
tombait
depuis
un
mois
sur
des
filles
inexpérimentées
qui
la
mettaient
dans
des
embarras
continuels
comme
zoé
le
recevait
il
la
poussa
tout
de
suite
dans
la
salle
à
manger
au
premier
mot
elle
eut
un
sourire
impossible
elle
quittait
madame
elle
sétablissait
à
son
compte
et
elle
ajouta
dun
air
de
vanité
discrète
que
chaque
jour
elle
recevait
des
propositions
ces
dames
se
la
disputaient
madame
blanche
lui
avait
fait
un
pont
dor
pour
la
ravoir
zoé
prenait
létablissement
de
la
tricon
un
vieux
projet
longtemps
couvé
une
ambition
de
fortune
où
allaient
passer
ses
économies
elle
était
pleine
didées
larges
elle
rêvait
dagrandir
la
chose
de
louer
un
hôtel
et
réunir
tous
les
agréments
cétait
même
à
ce
propos
quelle
avait
tâché
dembaucher
satin
une
petite
bête
qui
se
mourait
à
lhôpital
tellement
elle
se
gâchait
mignon
ayant
insisté
en
parlant
des
risques
que
lon
court
dans
le
commerce
zoé
sans
sexpliquer
sur
le
genre
de
son
établissement
se
contenta
de
dire
avec
un
sourire
pincé
comme
si
elle
avait
pris
une
confiserie
oh
les
choses
de
luxe
marchent
toujours
voyezvous
il
assez
longtemps
que
je
suis
chez
les
autres
je
veux
que
les
autres
soient
chez
moi
et
une
férocité
lui
retroussait
les
lèvres
elle
serait
enfin
madame
elle
tiendrait
à
ses
pieds
pour
quelques
louis
ces
femmes
dont
elle
rinçait
les
cuvettes
depuis
quinze
ans
mignon
voulut
se
faire
annoncer
et
zoé
le
laissa
un
instant
après
avoir
dit
que
madame
avait
passé
une
bien
mauvaise
journée
il
était
venu
une
seule
fois
il
ne
connaissait
pas
lhôtel
la
salle
à
manger
avec
ses
gobelins
son
dressoir
son
argenterie
létonna
il
ouvrit
familièrement
les
portes
visita
le
salon
le
jardin
dhiver
retourna
dans
le
vestibule
et
ce
luxe
écrasant
les
meubles
dorés
les
soies
et
les
velours
lemplissaient
peu
à
peu
dune
admiration
dont
son
coeur
battait
quand
zoé
redescendit
le
prendre
elle
offrit
de
lui
montrer
les
autres
pièces
le
cabinet
de
toilette
la
chambre
à
coucher
alors
dans
la
chambre
le
coeur
de
mignon
éclata
il
était
soulevé
jeté
à
un
attendrissement
denthousiasme
cette
sacrée
nana
le
stupéfiait
lui
qui
connaissait
pourtant
au
milieu
de
la
débâcle
de
la
maison
dans
le
coulage
dans
le
galop
de
massacre
des
domestiques
il
avait
un
entassement
de
richesses
bouchant
quand
même
les
trous
et
débordant
pardessus
les
ruines
et
mignon
en
face
de
ce
monument
magistral
se
rappelait
de
grands
travaux
près
de
marseille
lui
avait
montré
un
aqueduc
dont
les
arches
de
pierre
enjambaient
un
abîme
oeuvre
cyclopéenne
qui
coûtait
des
millions
et
dix
années
de
luttes
cherbourg
il
avait
vu
le
nouveau
port
un
chantier
immense
des
centaines
dhommes
suant
au
soleil
des
machines
comblant
la
mer
de
quartiers
de
roche
dressant
une
muraille
où
parfois
des
ouvriers
restaient
comme
une
bouillie
sanglante
mais
ça
lui
semblait
petit
nana
lexaltait
davantage
et
il
retrouvait
devant
son
travail
cette
sensation
de
respect
éprouvée
par
lui
un
soir
de
fête
dans
le
château
quun
raffineur
sétait
fait
construire
un
palais
dont
une
matière
unique
le
sucre
avait
payé
la
splendeur
royale
elle
cétait
avec
autre
chose
une
petite
bêtise
dont
riait
un
peu
de
sa
nudité
délicate
cétait
avec
ce
rien
honteux
et
si
puissant
dont
la
force
soulevait
le
monde
que
toute
seule
sans
ouvriers
sans
machines
inventées
par
des
ingénieurs
elle
venait
débranler
paris
et
de
bâtir
cette
fortune
où
dormaient
des
cadavres
ah
nom
de
dieu
quel
outil
laissa
échapper
mignon
dans
son
ravissement
avec
un
retour
de
gratitude
personnelle
nana
était
peu
à
peu
tombée
dans
un
gros
chagrin
dabord
la
rencontre
du
marquis
et
du
comte
lavait
secouée
dune
fièvre
nerveuse
où
il
entrait
presque
de
la
gaieté
puis
la
pensée
de
ce
vieux
qui
partait
dans
un
fiacre
à
moitié
mort
et
de
son
pauvre
mufe
quelle
ne
verrait
plus
après
lavoir
tant
fait
enrager
lui
causa
un
commencement
de
mélancolie
sentimentale
ensuite
elle
sétait
fâchée
en
apprenant
la
maladie
de
satin
disparue
depuis
quinze
jours
et
en
train
de
crever
à
lariboisière
tellement
madame
robert
lavait
mise
dans
un
fichu
état
comme
elle
faisait
atteler
pour
voir
encore
une
fois
cette
petite
ordure
zoé
venait
tranquillement
de
lui
donner
ses
huit
jours
du
coup
elle
fut
désespérée
il
lui
semblait
quelle
perdait
une
personne
de
sa
famille
mon
dieu
quallaitelle
devenir
toute
seule
et
elle
suppliait
zoé
qui
très
flattée
du
désespoir
de
madame
finit
par
lembrasser
pour
montrer
quelle
ne
partait
pas
fâchée
contre
elle
il
le
fallait
le
coeur
se
taisait
devant
les
affaires
mais
ce
jourlà
était
le
jour
aux
embêtements
nana
prise
de
dégoût
ne
songeant
plus
à

entre

phrases
à

de

son
regard
dun
mouvement
involontaire

usée
cependant
labordette

un
suicide

plongeon
du

un
bassin
des
fondettes

puis
la
gorge
serrée
depuis

elle
éclata
en
sanglots

se
soulagea

une
tristesse
infinie
quelque
chose
de
profond
et
dimmense
dont
elle
se
sentait
accablée
labordette
ayant
voulu
la
consoler
au
sujet
de
georges

le
fit

suffoquée
par

de

en

dun
divan
la

enfoncée
dans
un
coussin
les
malheurs

delle
ces
misères

noyaient
dun
flot
tiède
et

en
une
plainte
sourde
de

un
violent
coup
de
poing
sur
un
guéridon
nom
de

ce
nest

maintenant
lorsque

mon

sans

quils

dans

couvent
à
prier
le
bon
dieu
car

dit
labordette
convaincu
zoé
introduisait
mignon
nana
le
reçut
en
souriant
elle
avait
bien
pleuré
cétait
fini
il
la
complimenta
sur
son
installation
encore
chaud
denthousiasme
mais
elle
laissa
voir
quelle
avait
assez
de
son
hôtel
maintenant
elle
rêvait
autre
chose
elle
bazarderait
tout
un
de
ces
jours
puis
comme
il
donnait
un
prétexte
à
sa
visite
en
parlant
dune
représentation
au
bénéfice
du
vieux
bosc
cloué
dans
un
fauteuil
par
une
paralysie
elle
sapitoya
beaucoup
elle
lui
prit
deux
loges
cependant
zoé
ayant
dit
que
la
voiture
attendait
madame
elle
demanda
son
chapeau
et
tout
en
nouant
les
brides
elle
conta
laventure
de
cette
pauvre
satin
puis
ajouta
je
vais
à
lhôpital
personne
ne
aimée
comme
elle
ah
bien
raison
daccuser
les
hommes
de
manquer
de
coeur
qui
sait
je
ne
la
trouverai
peutêtre
plus
nimporte
je
demanderai
à
la
voir
je
veux
lembrasser
labordette
et
mignon
eurent
un
sourire
elle
nétait
plus
triste
elle
sourit
également
car
ils
ne
comptaient
pas
ces
deuxlà
ils
pouvaient
comprendre
et
tous
deux
ladmiraient
dans
un
silence
recueilli
tandis
quelle
achevait
de
boutonner
ses
gants
elle
demeurait
seule
debout
au
milieu
des
richesses
entassées
de
son
hôtel
avec
un
peuple
dhommes
abattus
à
ses
pieds
comme
ces
monstres
antiques
dont
le
domaine
redouté
était
couvert
dossements
elle
posait
les
pieds
sur
des
crânes
et
des
catastrophes
lentouraient
la
flambée
furieuse
de
vandeuvres
la
mélancolie
de
foucarmont
perdu
dans
les
mers
de
la
chine
le
désastre
de
steiner
réduit
à
vivre
en
honnête
homme
limbécillité
satisfaite
de
la
faloise
et
le
tragique
effondrement
des
muffat
et
le
blanc
cadavre
de
georges
veillé
par
philippe
sorti
la
veille
de
prison
son
oeuvre
de
ruine
et
de
mort
était
faite
la
mouche
envolée
de
lordure
des
faubourgs
apportant
le
ferment
des
pourritures
sociales
avait
empoisonné
ces
hommes
rien
qu
à
se
poser
sur
eux
cétait
bien
cétait
juste
elle
avait
vengé
son
monde
les
gueux
et
les
abandonnés
et
tandis
que
dans
une
gloire
son
sexe
montait
et
rayonnait
sur
ses
victimes
étendues
pareil
à
un
soleil
levant
qui
éclaire
un
champ
de
carnage
elle
gardait
son
inconscience
de
bête
superbe
ignorante
de
sa
besogne
bonne
fille
toujours
elle
restait
grosse
elle
restait
grasse
dune
belle
santé
dune
belle
gaieté
tout
ça
ne
comptait
plus
son
hôtel
lui
semblait
idiot
trop
petit
plein
de
meubles
qui
la
gênaient
une
misère
simplement
histoire
de
commencer
aussi
rêvaitelle
quelque
chose
de
mieux
et
elle
partit
en
grande
toilette
pour
embrasser
satin
une
dernière
fois
propre
solide
lair
tout
neuf
comme
si
elle
navait
pas
servi
xiv
nana
brusquement
disparut
un
nouveau
plongeon
une
fugue
une
envolée
dans
des
pays
baroques
avant
son
départ
elle
sétait
donné
lémotion
dune
vente
balayant
tout
lhôtel
les
meubles
les
bijoux
jusquaux
toilettes
et
au
linge
citait
des
chiffres

produisirent
plus
de
six
cent
mille
francs
une
dernière
fois
paris
lavait

dans
une
féerie
mélusine
au
théâtre
de
la
gaîté
que
bordenave
sans
un
sou
venait
de
prendre
par
un
coup
daudace
elle
se
retrouvait
là
avec
prullière
et
fontan
son
rôle
était
une
simple
figuration
mais
un
vrai
clou
trois
poses
plastiques
dune
fée
puissante
et
muette
puis
au
milieu
de
ce
grand
succès
quand
bordenave
enragé
de
réclames
allumait
paris
par
des
affiches
colossales
apprit
un
beau
matin
quelle
devait
être
partie
la
veille
pour
le
caire
une
simple
discussion
avec
son
directeur
un
mot
qui
ne
lui
avait
pas
convenu
le
caprice
dune
femme
trop
riche
pour
se
laisser
embêter
dailleurs
cétait
sa
toquade
depuis
longtemps
elle
rêvait
daller
chez
les
turcs
des
mois
se
passèrent
loubliait
lorsque
son
nom
revenait
parmi
ces
messieurs
et
ces
dames
les
plus
étranges
histoires
circulaient
chacun
donnait
des
renseignements
opposés
et
prodigieux
elle
avait
fait
la
conquête
du
viceroi
elle
régnait
au
fond
dun
palais
sur
deux
cents
esclaves
dont
elle
coupait
les
têtes
pour
rire
un
peu
pas
du
tout
elle
sétait
ruinée
avec
un
grand
nègre
une
sale
passion
qui
la
laissait
sans
une
chemise
dans
la
débauche
crapuleuse
du
caire
quinze
jours
plus
tard
ce
fut
un
étonnement
quelquun
jurait
lavoir
rencontrée
en
russie
une
légende
se
formait
elle
était
la
maîtresse
dun
prince
parlait
de
ses
diamants
toutes
les
femmes
bientôt
les
connurent
sur
les
descriptions
qui
couraient
sans
que
personne
pût
citer
une
source
exacte
des
bagues
des
boucles
doreilles
des
bracelets
une
rivière
large
de
deux
doigts
un
diadème
de
reine
surmonté
dun
brillant
central
gros
comme
le
pouce
dans
le
recul
de
ces
contrées
lointaines
elle
prenait
le
rayonnement
mystérieux
dune
idole
chargée
de
pierreries
maintenant
la
nommait
sérieusement
avec
le
respect
rêveur
de
cette
fortune
faite
chez
les
barbares
un
soir
de
juillet
vers
huit
heures
lucy
qui
descendait
en
voiture
la
rue
du
faubourgsainthonoré
aperçut
caroline
héquet
sortie
à
pied
pour
une
commande
chez
un
fournisseur
du
voisinage
elle
lappela
et
tout
de
suite
tu
dîné
tu
es
libre
oh

avec
moi

du
coup

et

voilà
une
idée
cria
caroline
stupéfaite
et
où

grand
hôtel

la
petite
vérole
oh
une
histoire
lucy
avait
dit
à
son
cocher
daller
bon
train
alors
au
trot
rapide
des
chevaux
le
long
de
la
rue
royale
et
des
boulevards
elle
conta
laventure
de
nana
en
paroles
coupées
sans
reprendre
haleine
tu
ne
peux
pas
timaginer
nana
débarque
de
russie
je
ne
sais
plus
pourquoi
un
attrapage
avec
son
prince
elle
laisse
ses
bagages
à
la
gare
elle
descend
chez
sa
tante
tu
te
rappelles
cette
vieille
bon
elle
tombe
sur
son
bébé
qui
avait
la
petite
vérole
le
bébé
meurt
le
lendemain
et
elle
sempoigne
avec
la
tante
à
propos
de
largent
quelle
devait
envoyer
et
dont
lautre
n
jamais
vu
un
sou
paraît
que
lenfant
est
mort
de
ça
enfin
un
enfant
lâché
et
pas
soigné
très
bien
nana
file
va
dans
un
hôtel
puis
rencontre
mignon
juste
comme
elle
songeait
à
ses
bagages
elle
devient
toute
chose
elle
des
frissons
des
envies
de
vomir
et
mignon
la
reconduit
chez
elle
en
lui
promettant
de
veiller
sur
ses
affaires
hein
estce
drôle
estce
machiné
mais
voici
le
plus
beau
rose
apprend
la
maladie
de
nana
sindigne
de
la
savoir
seule
dans
une
chambre
meublée
accourt
la
soigner
en
pleurant
tu
te
souviens
comme
elles
se
détestaient
deux
vraies
furies
eh
bien
chère
rose
fait
transporter
nana
au
grandhôtel
pour
quelle
mourût
au
moins
dans
un
endroit
chic
et
elle
déjà
passé
trois
nuits
quitte
à
en
crever
ensuite
cest
labordette
qui
raconté
ça
alors
jai
voulu
voir
oui
oui
interrompit
caroline
très
excitée
nous
allons
monter
elles
étaient
arrivées
sur
le
boulevard
le
cocher
avait
dû
retenir
ses
chevaux
au
milieu
dun
embarras
de
voitures
et
de
piétons
dans
la
journée
le
corps
législatif
venait
de
voter
la
guerre
une
foule
descendait
de
toutes
les
rues
coulait
le
long
des
trottoirs
envahissait
la
chaussée
du
côté
de
la
madeleine
le
soleil
sétait
couché
derrière
un
nuage
sanglant
dont
le
reflet
dincendie
faisait
flamber
les
fenêtres
hautes
un
crépuscule
tombait
une
heure
lourde
et
mélancolique
avec
lenfoncement
déjà
obscur
des
avenues
que
les
feux
des
becs
de
gaz
ne
piquaient
pas
encore
de
leurs
étincelles
vives
et
parmi
ce
peuple
en
marche
des
voix
lointaines
grandissaient
des
regards
luisaient
dans
des
faces
pâles
tandis
quun
grand
souffle
dangoisse
et
de
stupeur
épandu
emportait
toutes
les
têtes
voilà
mignon
dit
lucy
il
va
nous
donner
des
nouvelles
mignon
était
debout
sous
le
vaste
porche
du
grandhôtel
lair
nerveux
regardant
la
foule
aux
premières
questions
de
lucy
il
semporta
criant
estce
que
je
sais
voilà
deux
jours
que
je
ne
peux
arracher
rose
de
làhaut
cest
stupide
à
la
fin
de
risquer
sa
peau
ainsi
elle
sera
gentille
si
elle
passe
avec
des
trous
dans
la
figure
ça
nous
arrangera
bien
cette
idée
que
rose
pouvait
perdre
sa
beauté
lexaspérait
il
lâchait
nana
carrément
ne
comprenant
rien
aux
dévouements
bêtes
des
femmes
mais
fauchery
traversait
le
boulevard
et
lorsquil
fut
là
inquiet
lui
aussi
demandant
des
nouvelles
tous
deux
se
poussèrent
maintenant
ils
se
tutoyaient
toujours
la
même
chose
mon
petit
déclara
mignon
tu
devrais
monter
tu
la
forcerais
à
te
suivre
tiens
tu
es
bon
toi
dit
le
journaliste
pourquoi
n
montestu
pas
toimême
alors
comme
lucy
demandait
le
numéro
ils
la
supplièrent
de
faire
descendre
rose
autrement
ils
finiraient
par
se
fâcher
pourtant
lucy
et
caroline
ne
montèrent
pas
tout
de
suite
elles
avaient
aperçu
fontan
les
mains
dans
les
poches
flânant
très
amusé
des
bonnes
têtes
de
la
foule
quand
il
sut
que
nana
était
en
haut
malade
il
dit
en
jouant
le
sentiment
la
pauvre
fille
je
vais
lui
serrer
la
main
qu
atelle
donc
la
petite
vérole
répondit
mignon
lacteur
avait
déjà
fait
un
pas
vers
la
cour
mais
il
revint
il
murmura
simplement
avec
un
frisson
ah
bigre
ce
nétait
pas
drôle
la
petite
vérole
fontan
avait
failli
lavoir
à
lâge
de
cinq
ans
mignon
racontait
lhistoire
dune
de
ses
nièces
qui
en
était
morte
quant
à
fauchery
il
pouvait
en
parler
il
en
portait
encore
les
marques
trois
grains
à
la
naissance
du
nez
quil
montrait
et
comme
mignon
le
poussait
de
nouveau
sous
le
prétexte
quon
ne
lavait
jamais
deux
fois
il
combattit
cette
théorie
violemment
il
cita
des
cas
en
traitant
les
médecins
de
brutes
mais
lucy
et
caroline
les
interrompirent
surprises
de
la
cohue
croissante
voyez
donc
voyez
donc
en
voilà
du
monde
la
nuit
grandissait
des
becs
de
gaz
dans
le
lointain
sallumaient
un
à
un
cependant
aux
fenêtres
distinguait
des
curieux
tandis
que
sous
les
arbres
le
flot
humain
senflait
de
minute
en
minute
dans
une
coulée
énorme
de
la
madeleine
à
la
bastille
les
voitures
roulaient
avec
lenteur
un
ronflement
se
dégageait
de
cette
masse
compacte
muette
encore
venue
par
un
besoin
de
se
mettre
en
tas
et
piétinant
séchauffant
dune
même
fièvre
mais
un
grand
mouvement
fit
refluer
la
foule
au
milieu
des
bourrades
parmi
les
groupes
qui
sécartaient
une
bande
dhommes
en
casquette
et
en
blouse
blanche
avait
paru
jetant
ce
cri
sur
une
cadence
de
marteaux
battant
lenclume
berlin
à
berlin
à
berlin
et
la
foule
regardait
dans
une
morne
défiance
déjà
gagnée
pourtant
et
remuée
dimages
héroïques
comme
au
passage
dune
musique
militaire
oui
oui
allez
vous
faire
casser
la
gueule
murmura
mignon
pris
dun
accès
de
philosophie
mais
fontan
trouvait
ça
très
beau
il
parlait
de
sengager
quand
lennemi
était
aux
frontières
tous
les
citoyens
devaient
se
lever
pour
défendre
la
patrie
et
il
prenait
une
pose
de
bonaparte
à
austerlitz

et
le

retint
encore
les
deux
femmes
pour
le
leur
montrer
comme
il
levait
la
tête
elles
le
reconnurent
et
laissèrent
échapper
une
exclamation
cétait
le
comte
muffat
qui
jetait
un
regard
en

sur
une
des
fenêtres

est
venu
là
avec
son
mouchoir
sur
la
figure
toutes
les
demiheures
il
se
traîne
jusquici
pour
demander

et
il
retourne
sasseoir

cette
chambre
beau
aimer
les

n
pas
envie
de
crever
le
comte
les
yeux
levés
ne
semblait
pas
avoir
conscience
de
ce
qui
se
passait
autour
de
lui
il
ignorait
sans
doute
la
déclaration
de
guerre
il
ne
sentait
pas
il
nentendait
pas
la
foule
tiens
dit
fauchery
le
voilà
vous
allez
voir
en
effet
le
comte
avait
quitté
le
banc
et
entrait
sous
la
haute
porte
mais
le
concierge
qui
finissait
par
le
connaître
ne
lui
laissa
pas
le
temps
de
poser
sa
question
il
dit
dun
ton
brusque
monsieur
elle
est
morte
à
linstant
même
nana
morte
ce
fut
un
coup
pour
tout
le
monde
muffat
sans
une
parole
était
retourné
sur
le
banc
la
face
dans
son
mouchoir
les
autres
se
récriaient
mais
ils
eurent
la
parole
coupée
une
nouvelle
bande
passait
hurlant
berlin
à
berlin
à
berlin
nana
morte
par
exemple
une
si
belle
fille
mignon
soupira
dun
air
soulagé
enfin
rose
allait
descendre
il
eut
un
froid
fontan
qui
rêvait
un
rôle
tragique
avait
pris
une
expression
de
douleur
les
coins
de
la
bouche
tirés
les
yeux
renversés
au
bord
des
paupières
pendant
que
fauchery
réellement
touché
dans
sa
blague
de
petit
journaliste
mâchait
nerveusement
son
cigare
pourtant
les
deux
femmes
continuaient
à
sexclamer
la
dernière
fois
que
lucy
lavait
vue
cétait
à
la
gaîté
blanche
également
dans
mélusine
oh
épatante
chère
lorsquelle
paraissait
au
fond
de
la
grotte
de
cristal
ces
messieurs
se
la
rappelaient
très
bien
fontan
jouait
le
prince
cocorico
et
leurs
souvenirs
éveillés
ce
furent
des
détails
interminables
hein
dans
la
grotte
de
cristal
quel
chic
avec
sa
riche
nature
elle
ne
disait
pas
un
mot
même
les
auteurs
lui
avaient
coupé
une
réplique
parce
que
ça
gênait
non
rien
du
tout
cétait
plus
grand
et
elle
vous
retournait
son
public
rien
qu
à
se
montrer
un
corps
comme
nen
retrouverait
plus
des
épaules
des
jambes
et
une
taille
étaitce
drôle
quelle
fût
morte
vous
savez
quelle
avait
simplement
pardessus
son
maillot
une
ceinture
dor
qui
lui
cachait
à
peine
le
derrière
et
le
devant
autour
delle
la
grotte
toute
en
glace
faisait
une
clarté
des
cascades
de
diamants
se
déroulaient
des
colliers
de
perles
blanches
ruisselaient
parmi
les
stalactites
de
la
voûte
et
dans
cette
transparence
dans
cette
eau
de
source
traversée
dun
large
rayon
électrique
elle
semblait
un
soleil
avec
sa
peau
et
ses
cheveux
de
flamme
paris
la
verrait
toujours
comme
ça
allumée
au
milieu
du
cristal
en
lair
ainsi
quun
bon
dieu
non
cétait
trop
bête
de
se
laisser
mourir
dans
une
pareille
position
maintenant
elle
devait
être
jolie
làhaut
et
que
de
plaisir
fichu
dit
mignon
dune
voix
mélancolique
en
homme
qui
naimait
pas
à
voir
se
perdre
les
choses
utiles
et
bonnes
il
tâta
lucy
et
caroline
pour
savoir
si
elles
montaient
tout
de
même
bien
sûr
elles
montaient
leur
curiosité
avait
grandi
justement
blanche
arrivait
essoufflée
exaspérée
contre
la
foule
qui
barrait
les
trottoirs
et
quand
elle
sut
la
nouvelle
les
exclamations
recommencèrent
ces
dames
se
dirigèrent
vers
lescalier
avec
un
grand
bruit
de
jupes
mignon
les
suivait
en
criant
dites
à
rose
que
je
lattends
tout
de
suite
nestce
pas
ne
sait
pas
au
juste
si
la
contagion
est
à
craindre
au
début
ou
vers
la
fin
expliquait
fontan
à
fauchery
un
interne
de
mes
amis
massurait
même
que
les
heures
qui
suivent
la
mort
sont
surtout
dangereuses
il
se
dégage
des
miasmes
ah
je
regrette
ce
brusque
dénouement
jaurais
été
si
heureux
de
lui
serrer
la
main
une
dernière
fois
maintenant
à
quoi
bon
dit
le
journaliste
oui
à
quoi
bon
répétèrent
les
deux
autres
la
foule
augmentait
toujours
dans
le
coup
de
lumière
des
boutiques
sous
les
nappes
dansantes
du
gaz
distinguait
le
double
courant
des
trottoirs
qui
charriait
des
chapeaux
cette
heure
la
fièvre
gagnait
de
proche
en
proche
des
gens
se
jetaient
à
la
suite
des
bandes
en
blouse
une
poussée
continue
balayait
la
chaussée
et
le
cri
revenait
sortait
de
toutes
les
poitrines
saccadé
entêté
berlin
à
berlin
à
berlin
en
haut
au
quatrième
étage
la
chambre
coûtait
douze
francs
par
jour
rose
ayant
voulu
quelque
chose
de
convenable
sans
luxe
cependant
car
n
pas
besoin
de
luxe
pour
souffrir
tendue
de
cretonne
louis
xiii
à
grosses
fleurs
la
chambre
avait
le
mobilier
dacajou
de
tous
les
hôtels
avec
un
tapis
rouge
semé
dun
feuillage
noir
un
lourd
silence
régnait
coupé
dun
chuchotement
lorsque
des
voix
sélevèrent
dans
le
corridor
je
tassure
que
nous
sommes
perdues
le
garçon
dit
de
tourner
à
droite
en
voilà
une
caserne
attends

eh
par
ici
nous

ah
enfin
arrivez
chut
chut
les
voix
se
turent
toussa
se
recueillit
un
instant
puis
la
porte
ouverte
avec
lenteur
lucy
entra
suivie
de
caroline
et
de
blanche
mais
elles
sarrêtèrent
il
avait
déjà
cinq
femmes
dans
la
chambre
gaga
était
allongée
au
fond
de
lunique
fauteuil
un
voltaire
de
velours
rouge
devant
la
cheminée
simonne
et
clarisse
debout
causaient
avec
léa
de
horn
assise
sur
une
chaise
tandis
que
devant
le
lit
à
gauche
de
la
porte
rose
mignon
posée
au
bord
du
coffre
à
bois
regardait
fixement
le
corps
perdu
dans
lombre
des
rideaux
toutes
avaient
leurs
chapeaux
et
leurs
gants
comme
des
dames
en
visite
et
seule
les
mains
nues
décoiffée
pâlie
par
la
fatigue
de
trois
nuits
de
veille
elle
restait
stupide
et
gonflée
de
tristesse
en
face
de
cette
mort
si
brusque
au
coin
de
la
commode
une
lampe
garnie
dun
abatjour
éclairait
gaga
dun
coup
de
lumière
vive
hein
quel
malheur
murmura
lucy
en
serrant
la
main
de
rose
nous
voulions
lui
dire
adieu
et
elle
tournait
la
tête
pour
tâcher
de
la
voir
mais
la
lampe
était
trop
loin
elle
nosa
pas
la
rapprocher
sur
le
lit
une
masse
grise
sallongeait
distinguait
seulement
le
chignon
rouge
avec
une
tache
blafarde
qui
devait
être
la
figure
lucy
ajouta
moi
je
ne
lavais
plus
vue
depuis
la
gaîté
au
fond
de
la
grotte
alors
rose
sortant
de
sa
stupeur
eut
un
sourire
en
répétant
ah
elle
est
changée
elle
est
changée
puis
elle
retomba
dans
sa
contemplation
sans
un
geste
sans
une
parole
tout
à
lheure
pourrait
la
regarder
peutêtre
et
les
trois
femmes
rejoignirent
les
autres
devant
la
cheminée
simonne
et
clarisse
discutaient
sur
les
diamants
de
la
morte
à
voix
basse
enfin
existaientils
ces
diamants
personne
ne
les
avait
vus
ça
devait
être
une
blague
mais
léa
de
horn
connaissait
quelquun
qui
les
connaissait
oh
des
pierres
monstrueuses
dailleurs
ce
nétait
pas
tout
elle
avait
rapporté
bien
dautres
richesses
de
russie
des
étoffes
brodées
des
bibelots
précieux
un
service
de
table
en
jusqu
à
des
meubles
oui
chère
cinquantedeux
colis
des
caisses
énormes
de
quoi
charger
trois
wagons
ça
restait
en
gare
hein
pas
de
chance
mourir
sans
avoir
même
le
temps
de
déballer
ses
affaires
et
ajoutez
quelle
avait
des
sous
avec
ça
quelque
chose
comme
un
million
lucy
demanda
qui
héritait
des
parents
éloignés
la
tante
sans
doute
une
jolie
tuile
pour
cette
vieille
elle
ne
savait
rien
encore
la
malade
sétait
obstinée
à
ne
pas
la
faire
prévenir
lui
gardant
rancune
de
la
mort
de
son
petit
alors
toutes
sapitoyèrent
sur
le
petit
en
se
souvenant
de
lavoir
aperçu
aux
courses
un
bébé
plein
de
mal
et
qui
avait
lair
si
vieux
et
si
triste
enfin
un
de
ces
pauvres
mioches
qui
nont
pas
demandé
à
naître
il
est
plus
heureux
sous
la
terre
dit
blanche
bah
elle
aussi
ajouta
caroline
ce
nest
pas
si
drôle
lexistence
des
idées
noires
les
envahissaient
dans
la
sévérité
de
cette
chambre
elles
avaient
peur
cétait
bête
de
causer
là
si
longtemps
mais
un
besoin
de
voir
les
clouait
sur
le
tapis
il
faisait
très
chaud
le
verre
de
la
lampe
mettait
au
plafond
une
rondeur
de
lune
dans
lombre
moite
dont
la
pièce
était
noyée
sous
le
lit
une
assiette
creuse
pleine
de
phénol
dégageait
une
odeur
fade
et
par
moments
des
souffles
gonflaient
les
rideaux
de
la
fenêtre
ouverte
sur
le
boulevard
doù
montait
un
sourd
ronflement
atelle
beaucoup
souffert
demanda
lucy
qui
sétait
absorbée
devant
le
sujet
de
la
pendule
les
trois
grâces
nues
avec
des
sourires
de
danseuses
gaga
parut
séveiller
ah
oui
par
exemple
jétais
là
quand
elle
passé
je
vous
réponds
que
ça
n
rien
de
beau
tenez
elle
été
prise
dune
secousse
mais
elle
ne
put
continuer
son
explication
un
cri
sélevait
berlin
à
berlin
à
berlin
et
lucy
qui
étouffait
ouvrit
la
fenêtre
toute
grande
et
saccouda
là
il
faisait
bon
une
fraîcheur
tombait
du
ciel
étoilé
en
face
des
fenêtres
flambaient
des
reflets
de
gaz
dansaient
dans
les
lettres
dor
des
enseignes
puis
audessous
cétait
très
amusant
voyait
les
coulées
de
la
foule
rouler
comme
un
torrent
sur
les
trottoirs
et
la
chaussée
au
milieu
dune
confusion
de
voitures
dans
de
grandes
ombres
mouvantes
où
luisaient
les
étincelles
des
lanternes
et
des
becs
de
gaz
mais
la
bande
qui
arrivait
en
vociférant
avait
des
torches
une
lueur
rouge
venait
de
la
madeleine
coupait
la
cohue
dune
traînée
de
feu
sétalait
au
loin
sur
les
têtes
comme
une
nappe
dincendie
lucy
appela
blanche
et
caroline
soubliant
criant
venez
donc
voit
très
bien
de
cette
fenêtre
toutes
trois
se
penchèrent
très
intéressées
les
arbres
les
gênaient
par
moments
les
torches
disparaissaient
sous
les
feuilles
elles
tâchèrent
dapercevoir
ces
messieurs
en
bas
mais
la
saillie
dun
balcon
cachait
la
porte
et
elles
ne
distinguaient
toujours
que
le
comte
muffat
jeté
sur
le
banc
comme
un
paquet
sombre
le
visage
dans
son
mouchoir
une
voiture
sétait
arrêtée
lucy
reconnut
maria
blond
encore
une
qui
accourait
elle
nétait
pas
seule
un
gros
homme
descendait
derrière
elle
cest
ce
voleur
de
steiner
dit
caroline
comment
ne
l
pas
encore
renvoyé
à
cologne
je
veux
voir
sa
tête
quand
il
entrera
elles
se
tournèrent
mais
au
bout
de
dix
minutes
lorsque
maria
blond
parut
après
sêtre
deux
fois
trompée
descalier
elle
était
seule
et
comme
lucy
étonnée
linterrogeait
lui
ah

quil

cest
déjà
beau
quil
mait
accompagnée
jusqu
à
la
porte
ils
sont
près
dune
douzaine
qui
fument
des
cigares
en
effet
tous
ces
messieurs
se
retrouvaient
venus
en
flânant
pour
donner
un
coup
doeil
aux
boulevards
ils
sappelaient
ils
sexclamaient
sur
la
mort
de
cette
pauvre
fille
puis
ils
causaient
politique
et
stratégie
bordenave
daguenet
labordette
prullière
dautres
encore
avaient
grossi
le
groupe
et
ils
écoutaient
fontan
qui
expliquait
son
plan
de
campagne
pour
enlever
berlin
en
cinq
jours
cependant
maria
blond
prise
dattendrissement
devant
le
lit
murmurait
comme
les
autres
pauvre
chat
la
dernière
fois
que
je
lai
vue
cétait
à
la
gaîté
dans
la
grotte
ah
elle
est
changée
elle
est
changée
répéta
rose
mignon
avec
son
sourire
de
morne
accablement
deux
femmes
arrivèrent
encore
tatan
néné
et
louise
violaine
celleslà
battaient
le
grandhôtel
depuis
vingt
minutes
renvoyées
de
garçon
en
garçon
elles
avaient
monté
et
descendu
plus
de
trente
étages
au
milieu
dune
débâcle
de
voyageurs
qui
se
hâtaient
de
quitter
paris
dans
la
panique
de
la
guerre
et
de
cette
émotion
des
boulevards
aussi
en
entrant
se
laissèrentelles
tomber
sur
des
chaises
trop
lasses
pour
soccuper
de
la
morte
justement
un
vacarme
venait
de
la
chambre
voisine
roulait
des
malles
cognait
les
meubles
avec
tout
un
bruit
de
voix
broyant
des
syllabes
barbares
cétait
un
jeune
ménage
autrichien
gaga
racontait
que
pendant
lagonie
les
voisins
avaient
joué
à
se
poursuivre
et
comme
une
simple
porte
condamnée
séparait
les
deux
chambres
les
entendait
rire
et
sembrasser
quand
ils
sattrapaient
voyons
il
faut
partir
dit
clarisse
nous

la
ressusciterons
pas
vienstu
simonne
toutes
regardaient
le
lit
du
coin
de
loeil
sans
bouger
pourtant
elles
sapprêtaient
elles
donnaient
de
légères
tapes
sur
leurs
jupes
la
fenêtre
lucy
sétait
accoudée
de
nouveau
toute
seule
une
tristesse
peu
à
peu
la
serrait
à
la
gorge
comme
si
une
mélancolie
profonde
eût
monté
de
cette
foule
hurlante
des
torches
passaient
encore
secouant
des
flammèches
au
loin
les
bandes
moutonnaient
allongées
dans
les
ténèbres
pareilles
à
des
troupeaux
menés
de
nuit
à
labattoir
et
ce
vertige
ces
masses
confuses
roulées
par
le
flot
exhalaient
une
terreur
une
grande
pitié
de
massacres
futurs
ils
sétourdissaient
les
cris
se
brisaient
dans
livresse
de
leur
fièvre
se
ruant
à
linconnu
làbas
derrière
le
mur
noir
de
lhorizon
berlin
à
berlin
à
berlin
lucy
se
retourna
adossée
à
la
fenêtre
et
toute
pâle
mon
dieu
quallonsnous

ces
dames
hochèrent
la
tête
elles
étaient
graves
très
inquiètes
des
événements

fait
placer
toute
sa

à

ne

jamais
comment
une
guerre
peut
finir
mais
maria
blond
se
fâcha
elle
était
patriote
elle
parlait
de
suivre
larmée
en
voilà
une
traqueuse
oui
si
lon

de

je

en

pour

flanquer
des
coups
de

à
ces
cochons
de
prussiens
quand
nous
claquerions
toutes
après
une
jolie
chose
que
notre
peau
blanche
de
sivry
fut
exaspérée
ne

pas
de

des
prussiens
ce

des
hommes
pareils
aux
autres
et
qui
ne

toujours
sur

dos
des

comme
tes

dexpulser
le
petit
prussien
qui

très
riche

indignité

dun
sourire
elle
compléta
sa
pensée
tatan
néné
et
louise
violaine
étaient
de
cet
avis
la
première
raconta
quelle
avait
fait
des
noces
à
tout
casser
avec
des
militaires
oh
de
bons
garçons
et
qui
auraient
commis
les
cent
dixneuf
coups
pour
les
femmes
mais
ces
dames
ayant
trop
élevé
la
voix
rose
mignon
toujours
sur
le
coffre
devant
le
lit
les
fit
taire
dun
chut
soufflé
légèrement
elles
restèrent
saisies
avec
un
regard
oblique
vers
la
morte
comme
si
cette
prière
de
silence
fût
sortie
de
lombre
même
des
rideaux
et
dans
la
lourde
paix
qui
tomba
cette
paix
du
néant
où
elles
sentaient
la
rigidité
du
cadavre
étendu
près
delles
les
cris
de
la
foule
éclatèrent
berlin
à
berlin
à
berlin
mais
bientôt
elles
oublièrent
de
nouveau
léa
de
horn
qui
avait
un
salon
politique
où
danciens
ministres
de
louisphilippe
se
livraient
à
de
fines
épigrammes
reprit
très
bas
en
haussant
les
épaules
quelle
faute
cette
guerre
quelle
bêtise
sanglante
alors
tout
de
suite
lucy
prit
la
défense
de
lempire
elle
avait
couché
avec
un
prince
de
la
maison
impériale
cétait
pour
elle
affaire
de
famille
laissez
donc
chère
nous
ne
pouvions
nous
laisser
insulter
davantage
cette
guerre
est
lhonneur
de
la
france
oh
vous
savez
je
ne
dis
pas
ça
à
cause
du
prince
il
était
dun
rat
imaginezvous
le
soir
en
se
couchant
il
cachait
ses
louis
dans
ses
bottes
et
quand
nous
jouions
au
bézigue
il
mettait
des
haricots
parce
quun
jour
javais
fait
la
blague
de
sauter
sur
lenjeu
mais
ça
ne
mempêche
pas
dêtre
juste
lempereur
eu
raison
léa
hochait
la
tête
dun
air
de
supériorité
en
femme
qui
répète
lopinion
de
personnages
considérables
et
haussant
la
voix
cest
la
fin
ils
sont
fous
aux
tuileries
hier
voyezvous
la
france
aurait
dû
plutôt
les
chasser
toutes
linterrompirent
violemment
quavaitelle
donc
cette
enragéelà
après
lempereur
estce
que
le
monde
nétait
pas
heureux
estce
que
les
affaires
ne
marchaient
pas
jamais
paris
ne
samuserait
si
fort
gaga
semportait
réveillée
indignée
taisezvous
cest
idiot
vous
ne
savez
pas
ce
que
vous
dites
moi
jai
vu
louisphilippe
une
époque
de
panés
et
de
grigous
chère
et
puis
est
venu
quarantehuit
ah
une
jolie
chose
une
dégoûtation
leur
république
après
février
jai
crevé
la
faim
moi
qui
vous
parle
mais
si
vous
aviez
connu
tout
ça
vous
vous
mettriez
à
genoux
devant
lempereur
car
il
été
notre
père
oui
notre
père
dut
la
calmer
elle
reprit
dans
un
élan
religieux
mon
dieu
tâchez
que
lempereur
ait
la
victoire
conserveznous
lempire
toutes
répétèrent
ce
voeu
blanche
avoua
quelle
brûlait
des
cierges
pour
lempereur
caroline
prise
dun
béguin
sétait
promenée
pendant
deux
mois
sur
son
passage
sans
pouvoir
attirer
son
attention
et
les
autres
éclataient
en
paroles
furibondes
contre
les
républicains
parlaient
de
les
exterminer
à
la
frontière
afin
que
napoléon
iii
après
avoir
battu
lennemi
régnât
tranquille
au
milieu
de
la
jouissance
universelle
ce
sale
bismarck
en
voilà
encore
une
canaille
fit
remarquer
maria
blond
dire
que
je
lai
connu
cria
simonne
si
javais
pu
savoir
cest
moi
qui
aurais
mis
quelque
drogue
dans
son
verre
mais
blanche
ayant
toujours
sur
le
coeur
lexpulsion
de
son
prussien
osa
défendre
bismarck
il
nétait
peutêtre
pas
méchant
chacun
son
métier
elle
ajouta
vous
savez
quil
adore
les
femmes
questce
que
ça
nous
fiche
dit
clarisse
nous
navons
pas
envie
de
le
faire
peutêtre
des
hommes
comme
ça
il
en
toujours
de
trop
déclara
louise
violaine
gravement
vaudrait
mieux
sen
passer
que
davoir
affaire
à
de
pareils
monstres
et
la
discussion
continua
déshabillait
bismarck
chacune
lui
allongeait
un
coup
de
pied
dans
son
zèle
bonapartiste
pendant
que
tatan
néné
répétait
dun
air
vexé
bismarck
aton
fait
enrager
avec
celuilà
oh
je
lui
en
veux
moi
je
ne
le
connaissais
pas
ce
bismarck
ne
peut
pas
connaître
tout
le
monde
nimporte
dit
léa
de
horn
pour
conclure
ce
bismarck
va
nous
flanquer
une
jolie
tripotée
elle
ne
put
continuer
ces
dames
se
jetaient
sur
elle
hein
quoi
une
tripotée
cétait
bismarck
quon
allait
reconduire
chez
lui
à
coups
de
crosse
dans
le

avaitelle
fini
cette
mauvaise
française
chut
souffla
rose
mignon
blessée
dun
tel
tapage
le
froid
du
cadavre
les
reprit
elles
sarrêtèrent
toutes
à
la
fois
gênées
remises
en
face
de
la
mort
avec
la
peur
sourde
du
mal
sur
le
boulevard
le
cri
passait
enroué
déchiré
berlin
à
berlin
à
berlin
alors
comme
elles
se
décidaient
à
partir
une
voix
appela
du
corridor
rose
rose
étonnée
gaga
ouvrit
la
porte
disparut
un
instant
puis
quand
elle
revint
chère
cest
fauchery
qui
est
làbas
au
fond
il
ne
veut
pas
avancer
il
est
hors
de
lui
parce
que
vous
restez
près
de
ce
corps
mignon
avait
fini
par
pousser
le
journaliste
lucy
toujours
à
la
fenêtre
se
pencha
et
elle
aperçut
ces
messieurs
sur
le
trottoir
la
figure
en
lair
lui
faisant
de
grands
signes
mignon
exaspéré
tendait
les
poings
steiner
fontan
bordenave
et
les
autres
ouvraient
les
bras
dun
air
dinquiétude
et
de
reproche
tandis
que
daguenet
pour
ne
pas
se
compromettre
fumait
simplement
son
cigare
les
mains
derrière
le
dos
cest
vrai
chère
dit
lucy
en
laissant
la
fenêtre
ouverte
javais
promis
de
vous

péniblement
le

elle
murmura
je

mettre
une
soeur
et
elle
tournait
sans
pouvoir

chapeau
et
son
châle
machinalement
sur
la
toilette
elle
avait
empli
une
cuvette
deau
elle
se
lavait
les

et
le

en

à
empoisonner
la
chambre
ce
fut
une
panique
après
une
longue
insouciance
filons
filons
mes
petites
chattes
répétait
gaga
ce
nest
pas
sain
elles
sortaient
vivement
en
jetant
un
regard
sur
le
lit
mais
comme
lucy
blanche
et
caroline
étaient
encore
là
rose
donna
un
dernier
coup
doeil
pour
laisser
la
pièce
en
ordre
elle
tira
un
rideau
devant
la
fenêtre
puis
elle
songea
que
cette
lampe
nétait
pas
convenable
il
fallait
un
cierge
et
après
avoir
allumé
lun
des
flambeaux
de
cuivre
de
la
cheminée
elle
le
posa
sur
la
table
de
nuit
à
côté
du
corps
une
lumière
vive
éclaira
brusquement
le
visage
de
la
morte
ce
fut
une
horreur
toutes
frémirent
et
se
sauvèrent
ah
elle
est
changée
elle

changée

la
dernière
elle
partit
elle
ferma
la

seule

dans
la
clarté
de

un
charnier
un
tas
dhumeur
et
de
sang
une
pelletée
de
chair
corrompue
jetée
là
sur
un
coussin
les
pustules
avaient
envahi
la
figure
entière
un
bouton
touchant
lautre
et
flétries
affaissées
dun
aspect
grisâtre
de
boue
elles
semblaient
déjà
une
moisissure
de
la
terre
sur
cette
bouillie
informe
où
lon
ne
retrouvait
plus
les
traits
un
oeil
celui
de
gauche
avait
complètement
sombré
dans
le
bouillonnement
de
la
purulence

à

senfonçait
comme
un
trou
noir
et
gâté
le
nez
suppurait
encore
toute
une
croûte
rougeâtre
partait
dune
joue
envahissait
la
bouche

tirait
dans
un
rire
abominable
et
sur
ce
masque
horrible

grotesque
du
néant
les

avait
empoisonné
